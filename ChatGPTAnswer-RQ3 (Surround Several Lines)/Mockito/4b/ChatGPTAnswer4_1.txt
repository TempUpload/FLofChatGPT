This means somewhere in the code, there is an attempt to handle a Boolean value as if it were a String, and this is not allowed in Java.\nThe error message indicates that the problem is within the toString method of a mock created using Mockito (as seen from the package name org.mockitousage.bugs and the name of the test class ClassCastExOnVerifyZeroInteractionsTest).
