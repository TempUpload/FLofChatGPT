This may lead to poor performance in hash-based collections, such as HashMaps, because all entries would end up in the same bucket. It also goes against the general contract of the hashCode() method which says that if two objects are not equal (as per the equals() method) then it is not required but desirable for them to have distinct hash codes."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nIt\'s worth noting that the primary concern here is performance and the general contract of the hashCode method. If two objects are different, ideally they should not return the same hash code. However, it\'s not always necessary as long as it\'s consistent with the equals method, which means if two objects are equal, they must return the same hash code. But here, returning a constant value for all objects isn\'t ideal.'}}]
