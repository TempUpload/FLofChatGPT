The expected output was "PT-0.008S" but the actual output is "PT0.008S". The discrepancy is the absence of a negative sign in the actual output, which suggests that the negative sign might not be correctly handled when the period contains only milliseconds.\nLet\'s update the fault localization with this context:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function calculates the number of digits required to print a value, taking into account various field types related to date-time (like seconds, milliseconds, etc.), and ensuring a minimum number of printed digits.",\n\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1098,\n      "codeContent": "sum = Math.max(sum, 4);",\n      "reason": "The code assumes that the minimum number of digits required when including milliseconds is 4 (0.000).
