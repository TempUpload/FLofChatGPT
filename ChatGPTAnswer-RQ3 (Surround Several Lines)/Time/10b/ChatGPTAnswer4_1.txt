Considering that the code snippet from the first prompt and the unit test case, the error seems to arise when trying to calculate the number of days between two MonthDay objects, one of which has the day set to 29.\nNow, let\'s analyze the code snippet from the first prompt with respect to this error.\nJSON Result:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function appears to validate if the \'start\' is contiguous using DateTimeUtils, then it retrieves an array \'values\' by processing \'start\' and \'end\' objects.
