While this is needed because Java\'s Calendar uses 0-based months, it can result in an invalid month number (13) if the original month is December (11).\nThe code retrieves the year using Calendar.YEAR, which might be incorrect if you are dealing with dates in the BCE era.\nThe function throws an IllegalArgumentException if the calendar object is null.
