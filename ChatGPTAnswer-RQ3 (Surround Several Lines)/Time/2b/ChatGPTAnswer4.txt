If they are standard Java classes (in some library like Joda-Time) with the mentioned methods, their behaviors and exceptions may be specified differently in their documentation.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'The provided error message, unit test case, and code snippet suggest that the function may be used in the Partial class of the Joda-Time library.
