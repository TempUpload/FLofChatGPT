Additionally, properly handle cases where all values are negative.', 5: 'Given the additional context of the error message and the provided unit test case, we can now narrow down the issues related to the getLInfNorm method. The error message indicates that the expected result was 6.0, but the method returned -3.0. This suggests that the method is not correctly computing the L-infinity norm. Given the vector [-4, 0, 3, 1, -6, 3] and considering the L-infinity norm, the maximum absolute value should be 6.\nThe following is the updated JSON analysis based on the above insights:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "To compute the L-infinity norm of a collection of values.
