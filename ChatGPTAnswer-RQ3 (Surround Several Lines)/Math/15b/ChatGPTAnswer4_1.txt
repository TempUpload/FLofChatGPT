Let\'s analyze the initial code snippet with this information:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "To handle a special case where x is negative and compute the power of -x raised to y based on certain conditions related to y.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1542,\n      "codeContent": "return pow(-x, y);",\n      "reason": "Given the error message, this line stands out as the primary suspect.
