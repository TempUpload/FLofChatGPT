The correct approach would be to return NaN if either \'a\' or \'b\' is NaN, not just if their sum is NaN."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe function seems to have a logic error that causes it to always return the second parameter, even when the first one is greater. This issue is confirmed by the unit test case that failed (max(50.0, -50.0) was expected to return 50.0 but returned -50.0 instead).\nThe NaN check also appears to be incorrect, as it is performed on the sum of the two parameters rather than each parameter individually. However, this would only cause an issue if either parameter is NaN. Thus, the logic of this function seems to be flawed and does not correctly implement the concept of a \'max\' function.'}}]
