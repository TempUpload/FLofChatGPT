However, the unit test adds a large number of observed points (40000), which likely causes the size of the weight array to grow, leading to a large matrix being created and subsequently the error. Solutions could include optimizing the matrix storage, increasing heap space, or reconsidering the need for such a large matrix.', 1: 'Given the provided error message and considering the code snippet from the first prompt, it appears that the main issue is the Java heap space running out of memory.

The root cause seems to be the size of the weight array passed to the Weight constructor, which in turn defines the size of the weightMatrix.
