The provided unit test case tests the multiplication of two Complex numbers, expecting the result of multiplying new Complex(0,1) and new Complex(-1,0) to be new Complex(0,-1).\nBased on the error message and the code snippet from the first prompt, the bug likely resides in the implementation of the equality check (equals method) for the Complex class or the multiplication method.\nGiven this context, here\'s an updated analysis of the provided code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function appears to check the equality of the current instance of a Complex number with another object (potentially another Complex number).
