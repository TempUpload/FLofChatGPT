Therefore, additional checks could be added to the code to prevent such cases.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'json\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function getSumSquaredErrors() is intended to calculate and return the sum of squared errors (SSE) using three variables: sumYY, sumXY, and sumXX.

The unit test failed because it expected the sum of squared errors (SSE) to be non-negative. This adds another level of complexity to the previously identified potential bug. In statistical theory, the SSE should indeed be non-negative. However, the given formula can produce a negative value for SSE under certain conditions. This is highly suspicious and could indicate that the formula might not be implemented correctly or is being used in an incorrect context.'}}]
