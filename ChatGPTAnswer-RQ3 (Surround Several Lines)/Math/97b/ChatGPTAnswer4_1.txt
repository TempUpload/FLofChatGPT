In such a case, the root is technically bracketed (or is one of the end points), but this check would incorrectly throw an exception.\nLine 138: The check for sign >= 0 might not be robust enough. For numerical algorithms, it is often better to check if a value is sufficiently close to zero, rather than exactly zero.
