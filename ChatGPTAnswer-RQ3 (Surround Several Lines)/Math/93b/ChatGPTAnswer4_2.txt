The error message suggests that the value returned by factorialDouble(n) may not be precisely equal to the expected value when rounded to a long. This implicates line 345 as the most likely source of the error, followed by other potential pitfalls in lines 346 and 350.', 1: 'Based on the error message and the original code snippet, the function seems to be used in a testing environment to compute factorial values. The error message is an "AssertionFailedError," which indicates that the test expected a specific value that was not equal to the value returned by the function.
