Therefore, it\'s not clear what the function does or if it correctly computes the factorial in double format.\nUsing Math.round suggests that the factorial might be computed as a floating-point number. Depending on the range of n, this could lead to precision errors.\nif (result == Long.MAX_VALUE) { ... }:\nThis check seems to be testing whether the computed factorial is too large to fit in a long. However, just checking if the result is equal to Long.MAX_VALUE might not be sufficient. The result might exceed Long.MAX_VALUE but get truncated or rounded and not be exactly equal to Long.MAX_VALUE.\nreturn factorials[n];:\nThere\'s an array factorials that is accessed here, but this array is not defined or initialized within the provided code.

The unit test error message indicates a discrepancy in precision. The error seems to stem from the result of factorial(17), as indicated by "17! expected:<3.55687428096E14> but was:<3.55687428096001E14>".
