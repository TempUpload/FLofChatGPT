This could lead to a NullPointerException if the method being called expects these objects and they aren\'t passed, hence are null.\nLine 70 still indicates that the function accepts parameters that it does not use, which can be misleading and potentially problematic.\nLine 71 is less likely to cause the NullPointerException but is still misleading because it claims to throw exceptions that are not actually thrown within the function.'}}]
