This new Line object represents a line with the reversed direction from the original line.",\n    "faultLocalization": [\n        {\n            "lineNumber": 87,\n            "codeContent": "final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction));",\n            "reason": "The operation \'zero.subtract(direction)\' does not seem to be correctly negating the \'direction\'. It appears to be trying to compute the negation by subtracting the direction from \'zero\', but depending on the internal implementation of \'subtract\', this might not be achieving the intended result. If \'zero\' represents the origin vector (all components 0), then this should theoretically work, but there might be precision issues."\n        }\n    ]\n}\nThe core suspicion lies in how subtraction is handled by the subtract method in relation to the vector\'s precision. In high-precision calculations, small discrepancies (like the ones observed in the error message) can arise due to the way floating-point arithmetic is implemented in computers.'}}]
