The unit test testBigDataSet tests the Mann-Whitney U Test on a big data set with 1500 elements in each array (d1 and d2). The test expects the result to be greater than 0.1. However, the test fails due to an unspecified assertion failure. Since we can\'t see the exact value that causes the assertion to fail, and given that we don\'t have the full code, it\'s difficult to diagnose the exact reason for the test failure based solely on the calculateAsymptoticPValue snippet.\nHere is the updated JSON object after considering the additional context:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'calculateAsymptoticPValue\' aims to calculate the asymptotic P-value based on the Mann-Whitney U test statistic (Umin) and sample sizes (n1, n2).
