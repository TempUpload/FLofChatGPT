It also considers two NaN values to be equal.\nFault Localization:\nLine 417: The function does not correctly handle the case when x and y are Double.NaN. In some contexts, users might expect that NaN should be equal to NaN, but this implementation would return false if both x and y are Double.NaN. This could be confusing and inconsistent with some users\' expectations, especially when using this method in the context of array comparison.\nLine 417: Comparing floating-point numbers using the equality operator == can be problematic due to precision errors. In the unit test, the method fails when nearly equal double-precision floating-point numbers are compared, which might be due to this issue.'}}]
