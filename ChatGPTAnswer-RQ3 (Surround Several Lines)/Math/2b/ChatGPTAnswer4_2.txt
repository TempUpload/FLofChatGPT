This issue could be stemming from the getNumericalMean() function, though it\'s important to note that without the full context of all the methods involved, the analysis remains limited.\nHere is an updated JSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function getNumericalMean() is intended to calculate and return the numerical mean of some data set based on the Hypergeometric Distribution, using the formula (SampleSize * NumberOfSuccesses) / PopulationSize.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 268,\n      "codeContent": "return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();",\n      "reason": "Potential division by zero.

If either getSampleSize() or getNumberOfSuccesses() return negative values, the mean would be negative, which may not be expected in the context of a distribution."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 268,\n      "codeContent": "return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();",\n      "reason": "No error handling or null checks for the methods getSampleSize(), getNumberOfSuccesses(), and getPopulationSize(). If any of these methods return null or raise an exception, the function would fail."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe main concerns are the potential division by zero and lack of error handling. Additionally, considering the negative sample value shown in the error message, there might be a chance that the mean could go negative if either getSampleSize() or getNumberOfSuccesses() are negative, which is typically not expected in such distributions.'}}]
