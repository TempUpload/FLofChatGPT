This exception occurs when you try to store a value in an array of a different type than the array was declared to hold.\nGiven this additional information, here\'s an updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The intent of this function is to create an array `out` of generic type `T` with size `sampleSize`.

The sample() function is probably returning an object whose type does not match the type of the array out. This could be related to how the array out is instantiated at line 187. The method singletons.get(0).getClass() retrieves the class of the first object in singletons, and it\'s assumed that the sample() function will return an object of that same class type, which may not be the case as evidenced by the unit test failure.'}}]
