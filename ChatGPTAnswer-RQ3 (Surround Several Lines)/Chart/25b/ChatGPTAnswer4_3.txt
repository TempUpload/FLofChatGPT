However, the actual code snippet you provided doesn\'t have a clear reference to the mean value being processed directly. Instead, we see computations involving meanValue which is not defined in the provided snippet.

It then converts these values into graphical coordinates, probably to render a visual representation of the standard deviation relative to the mean value.\nFault Localization\nThe testDrawWithNullMeanVertical test case tries to test the scenario where the mean value is null (as seen in line 195 of the unit test case). The test case fails with a NullPointerException.

If a null meanValue is expected behavior in some scenarios (as the test suggests), the code should handle that case gracefully without throwing exceptions.'}}]
