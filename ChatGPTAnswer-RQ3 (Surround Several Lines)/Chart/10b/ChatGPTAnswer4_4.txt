However, there are issues with the way the string is being concatenated, especially the misplaced line break and the non-existent \'toolTipText66\' variable.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'Given the additional information provided, including the error message and the unit test case, we can better understand the discrepancy.

To fix the function, not only should the syntax error be addressed, but the function should also replace any occurrences of double quotes in the tooltip text with &quot; before embedding it into the resulting string.'}}]
