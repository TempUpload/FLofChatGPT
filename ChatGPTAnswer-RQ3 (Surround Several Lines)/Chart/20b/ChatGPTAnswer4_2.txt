The unit test expects the outline paint to be blue (Color.blue), but it is red (Color.red). This discrepancy likely arises from the fact that the super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha) line uses the paint and stroke arguments twice, rather than using outlinePaint and outlineStroke for the third and fourth arguments.\nThe parameters outlinePaint and outlineStroke are declared but not utilized in the constructor function. This correlates with the error in the unit test, as it is likely that outlinePaint and outlineStroke are supposed to be used in the super() call to set the appropriate properties in the parent class.\nBoth of these issues indicate a high level of suspicion that they are the source of the bug, as evidenced by the unit test error. The code snippet contains only these two lines that are likely to be problematic, so only two entries are present in the \'faultLocalization\' array.'}}]
