However, it appears to be deferring actual argument validation.\nThe key issue here is that even though the zone parameter is provided to the function, it\'s not used in the initialization call on line 175. Instead, a default time zone (RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE) is used, which may lead to unexpected behavior.'}}]
