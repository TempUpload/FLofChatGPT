The specific exception, java.lang.IllegalStateException, is thrown at a method applyAlias in the ScopedAliases class.\nHowever, the provided code snippet is related to processing JSDoc information. Without having access to the full ScopedAliases class and knowing exactly how it interacts with the provided code snippet, it\'s challenging to correlate the error message directly with the code snippet. However, based on the provided details, here is the analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function seems to be designed to process JSDoc information associated with a node, and make adjustments to type nodes within that JSDoc.
