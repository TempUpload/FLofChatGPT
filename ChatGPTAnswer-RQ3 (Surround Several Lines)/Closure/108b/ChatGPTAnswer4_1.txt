Given the error message, it seems likely that this method is causing the IllegalStateException by encountering a condition it didn\'t expect.\nThe loop iterating over type nodes (info.getTypeNodes()) becomes suspect because the error message and test case indicate an issue with types, potentially causing the IllegalStateException.\nThe getJSDocInfo() method could potentially return inconsistent or incorrect JSDocInfo data, which might be a root cause for the IllegalStateException.\nThe if (info != null) { line checks if info is null but doesn\'t specify what should happen otherwise. This may be a problem if the function implicitly assumes that info should never be null.\nA comment in the code mentions that jsdoc is duplicated, which is not addressed in the function. This could potentially lead to issues if not handled properly.'}}]
