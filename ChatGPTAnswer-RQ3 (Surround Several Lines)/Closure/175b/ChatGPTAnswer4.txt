This decision is made based on the presence of side effects in the code, identified by the method NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(). If there are side effects, the function is expected to return CanInlineResult.NO, indicating that inlining should not happen. Otherwise, it should return CanInlineResult.YES, indicating that inlining can occur.",\n\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 729,\n      "codeContent": "if (NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(cArg, compiler)) {",\n      "reason": "This line of code determines whether or not \'cArg\' can be inlined based on the presence of side effects.
