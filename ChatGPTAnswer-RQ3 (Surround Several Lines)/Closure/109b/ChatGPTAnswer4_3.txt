If the function parseContextTypeExpression is intended to perform additional logic or error handling apart from calling parseTypeName, then this would be a potential issue.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'Based on the error message, it appears that the function parseTypeName (which parseContextTypeExpression calls) may have an issue with type annotation parsing that results in a syntax error.

Especially given the error message, it would be worth considering whether parseContextTypeExpression should include additional error handling, logging, or validation to better diagnose or prevent the issues seen in the error message.'}}]
