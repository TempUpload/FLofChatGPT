However, the function in the provided error message and test case is different from the code snippet in the first prompt, and I am asked to focus exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, not the unit test case. As a result, the error message and unit test case cannot be used to improve the analysis of the code snippet from the first prompt.\nThus, my previous analysis of potential bugs in the code snippet would not change, as it was not related to type checking problems and the code in the error message and test case is unrelated to the code in the original snippet.
