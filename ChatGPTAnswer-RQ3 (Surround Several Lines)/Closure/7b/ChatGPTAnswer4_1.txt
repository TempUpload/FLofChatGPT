The error message suggests that there might be a type mismatch issue in the code¡ªparticularly, the object type is missing in the returned type.\nHere is the updated JSON object describing the intended purpose and fault localization:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'caseObjectType\' appears to handle type matching for JavaScript object types.

These lines could be the cause of the issue, given that they can exclude \'Object\' from the types.'}}]
