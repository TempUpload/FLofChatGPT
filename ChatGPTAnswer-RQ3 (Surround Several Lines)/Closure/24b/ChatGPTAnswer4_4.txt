The function doesn\'t seem to be identifying and throwing errors for variables that aren\'t properly aliased, which is likely the issue the unit test is highlighting. The function might need further conditions and checks to correctly identify non-aliased variables.', 1: 'Given the error message and the unit test case, it seems that the test testNonAliasLocal is expecting the code under test (presumably related to the provided code snippet from the first prompt) to produce a specific error (ScopedAliases.GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL).
