If it does, the function returns \'TernaryValue.TRUE\'.\n\'faultLocalization\':\nThe first fault is at line 372. The return type of the function is \'TernaryValue\', which suggests that it could return one of three states (\'TRUE\', \'FALSE\', \'UNKNOWN\' usually). However, the function only returns \'TRUE\' when \'c\' matches a particular whitespace character, without any indication of what it returns otherwise.\nThe second fault is at line 373. The \'switch\' statement doesn\'t have a \'default\' case, which would handle unexpected or unknown values of \'c\'. It\'s generally a good practice to include a \'default\' case in a \'switch\' statement.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'Given the error message and the initial code snippet provided, we can determine a few potential issues related to the function isStrWhiteSpaceChar:\nThe function checks for whitespace characters, but its return type is TernaryValue, suggesting three potential states (e.g., TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN). However, the function only returns TernaryValue.TRUE for known whitespace characters and has no default return value for non-whitespace characters or unrecognized characters.\nThe function does not handle the \'\\v\' (vertical tab) character, which is given in the error message as \'\\u000b\'. It appears to be expected as a whitespace character based on the test case, but it\'s not properly recognized or labeled in the function.\nGiven these points, let\'s format the results in the desired JSON:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'isStrWhiteSpaceChar\' aims to check if the given integer \'c\' represents a whitespace character.
