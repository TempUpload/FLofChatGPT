The error message indicates that the test expected "x- -0.0" but got "x--0.0", meaning that there is supposed to be a space between the two negative signs for clarity.\nHere\'s the updated analysis in JSON format, now with the additional context provided by the error message and unit test case:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to add a double value \'x\' to some output while handling special formatting cases, such as negative zero and adjacent negative signs, to ensure clarity and syntactical correctness.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 245,\n      "codeContent": "if (x < 0 && prev == \'-\') {",\n      "reason": "The condition checks if \'x\' is less than 0 and if the last character was a \'-\'.
