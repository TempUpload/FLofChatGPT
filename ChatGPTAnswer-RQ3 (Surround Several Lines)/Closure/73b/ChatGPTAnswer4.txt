The error message suggests that the function should output unicode escaped characters for values such as \'\\x7f\', but instead, it is directly outputting the ASCII character associated with the value. The correct behavior as per the failing test case would be to output the Unicode representation of \'\\x7f\' as \'\\u007f\'.
