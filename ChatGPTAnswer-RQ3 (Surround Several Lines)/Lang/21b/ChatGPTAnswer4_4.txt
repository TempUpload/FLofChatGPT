The safer alternative for a 24-hour comparison is Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY.\nThe line at 260 suggests that there should be a null check somewhere before this line for cal1 and cal2, but this check isn\'t present in the provided snippet.\nLine 269 uses \'==\' for class comparison. Even though this works correctly for class objects, for clarity and consistency, it\'s typically better to use .equals() for object comparisons.'}}]
