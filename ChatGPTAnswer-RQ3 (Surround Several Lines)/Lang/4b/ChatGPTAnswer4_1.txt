When translating a sequence, it\'s supposed to return the number of codepoints (characters) consumed from the input sequence during the translation. The error message shows that instead of consuming three codepoints ("one"), it didn\'t consume any. Therefore, the error likely lies in the code handling the translation and codepoint consumption, which was not included in the provided code snippet.\nConsidering this context, it becomes clear that the existing code snippet only prepares the lookupMap and does not appear to be directly responsible for the error reported in the test.
