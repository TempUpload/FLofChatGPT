We don\'t know if this function could throw other exceptions, have performance issues, or handle edge cases incorrectly. Also, no input validation is performed before calling this function.\nThe function signature declares that it throws IOException. While this may be appropriate given the usage of Writer, without knowing what escapeJavaStyleString does, we cannot be certain that no other exceptions should be caught or thrown.\nThere is a lack of input validation.
