Please note that the function does not contain any logic to handle negative integers despite the comment on line 587 and 589. It is also crucial to remember that the function should be able to handle the GCD calculation for any two integers, not just for 1 or -1. Also, the condition to return 1 in case of one or both numbers being 0 is incorrect.'}, 'answer2': {0: 'Given the error message and the code snippet, the error seems to be related to a mathematical calculation, probably from a result in the greatestCommonDivisor function.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function intends to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \'u\' and \'v\'.

The operation might be related to a result in the greatestCommonDivisor function. The error message is showing that an expected value of -1073741824 is being calculated as -2147483648 instead. Without the remaining part of the greatestCommonDivisor function and the code of Fraction.getReducedFraction, it is difficult to precisely pinpoint where this miscalculation occurs.'}}]
