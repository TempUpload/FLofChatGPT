The original code snippet you provided was about unregistering an object from a registry using IDKey. Now, the error message and test case hint at a problem in HashCodeBuilder related to an object cycle.\nEven though the error message and the unit test case seem to revolve around a StackOverflowError due to cyclic references, the code snippet from the first prompt doesn\'t seem directly related to this problem.
