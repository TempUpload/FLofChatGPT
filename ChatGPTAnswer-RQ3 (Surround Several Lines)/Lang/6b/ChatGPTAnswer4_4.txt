It seems this line is where the out-of-bounds index is occurring. There is no check to ensure that \'pos\' does not exceed the length of \'input\', leading to the error.\nLine 94 could potentially exacerbate the issue identified in line 95 by not checking if iterating \'consumed\' times will lead \'pos\' to exceed the length of \'input\'.\nGiven that the error message points to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException and refers to Character.codePointAt, it strongly suggests that the identified lines are the likely source of the problem.'}}]
