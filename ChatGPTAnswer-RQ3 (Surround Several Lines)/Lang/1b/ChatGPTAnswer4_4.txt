Since the line that calls createInteger is the same line from the code snippet, it\'s the most suspicious.\nThe test case shows that "0x80000000" is being parsed as an integer while it should actually be parsed as a long. This could be due to the logic at line 471 that determines whether to treat the hex number as an Integer or a Long based on the number of hex digits, which seems to be incorrect in this case.'}}]
