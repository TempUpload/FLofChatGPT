[{'answer1': 'The code provided is a method named appendFixedWidthPadRight of the StrBuilder class.

This exception typically occurs when an attempt is made to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array. The valid range of indices for any array is from 0 to the length of the array - 1.
