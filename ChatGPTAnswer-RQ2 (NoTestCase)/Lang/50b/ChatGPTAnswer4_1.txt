[{'answer1': 'Based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be a Java function that obtains a FastDateFormat instance for a given style, timezone, and locale. The code first creates a key based on these parameters, checks a cache (cDateInstanceCache) to see if the format is already available. If not, it creates a new FastDateFormat instance, puts it in the cache, and then returns the format.
