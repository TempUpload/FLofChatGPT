The line 489 corresponds to the exp = str.substring(expPos + 1, str.length() - 1); statement in the provided code. This operation could potentially lead to such an exception if the expPos + 1 or str.length() - 1 index is out of range for the str string.\nThe function still intends to convert a string to a number, and the type of number is determined by the format of the string.
