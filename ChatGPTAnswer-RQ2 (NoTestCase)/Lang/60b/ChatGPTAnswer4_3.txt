[{'answer1': 'Based on the given code, it appears that the intended function of this method is to iterate over a character array (thisBuf, presumably assigned elsewhere), and return true if the character (ch) is found within the array.

The function appears to be correctly checking for the existence of a character in a character array, and correctly returning a boolean based on that check.
