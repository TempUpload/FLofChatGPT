However, without the broader context, these may or may not be actual bugs. The function name might be misleading, or the intended functionality might be missing, but further information would be necessary to make a definitive judgment.', 'answer2': 'Given the new information from the error message, we can re-analyze the provided code snippet:\njava\nCopy code\n116: private static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n117:     return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n118: }\nError Message Highlights:\nExpected function but was call Reference node CALL\nThe error seems to stem from an issue with the AstValidator.validateFunctionExpression method.\nAnalysis:\nBased on the information provided by the error message, it appears there is a type expectation issue within the NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n) function.
