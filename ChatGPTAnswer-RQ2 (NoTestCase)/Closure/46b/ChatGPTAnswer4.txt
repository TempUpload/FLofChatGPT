Some assumptions might not be accurate without the larger context of the application. It\'s also possible there are additional issues or nuances that are not visible from this snippet alone.', 'answer2': 'The error message indicates that the function getLeastSupertype is not producing the expected result in the context of merging two record types. Given the error message, the function is expected to produce a supertype that encompasses both the properties of the current type (this) and the provided type (that).
