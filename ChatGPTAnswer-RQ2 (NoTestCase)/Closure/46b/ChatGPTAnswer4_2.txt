It\'s a common practice to handle such potential null values in Java.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, we can infer that the function does not correctly determine the least supertype. Specifically, it seems to only return the properties that are equivalent between the two types, rather than returning a union of both types.\nUpdated analysis based on the error message:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to determine the least supertype between the current JSType object and another provided JSType object (named \'that\').
