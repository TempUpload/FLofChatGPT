The error message provided shows an assertion failure related to the specific transformation in the code under test. Since the error message doesn\'t directly refer to a line or piece of code within the isFoldableExpressBlock function, it makes diagnosing the issue in that specific code snippet more difficult. However, we can make some assumptions and observations that could be related to the unit test failure.\nBased on the code snippet and error message, here\'s an updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'isFoldableExpressBlock\' checks if a given Node \'n\' is a foldable express block, aiming to handle an Internet Explorer bug.

These issues might not be directly related to the failure of the specific test case (testIssue291), but they are potential concerns within the code snippet. If further context or related code is provided, a more specific analysis could be conducted.'}]
