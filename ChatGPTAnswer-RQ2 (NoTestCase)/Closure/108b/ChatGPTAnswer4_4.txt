However, the error may be a consequence of the state or data that the visit method (from the provided snippet) is setting or changing. The suggestions provided above focus on potential pitfalls, redundancies, and areas of improvement in the snippet. Actual behavior should be tested in context with the full source code to pinpoint the exact cause of the error.'}]
