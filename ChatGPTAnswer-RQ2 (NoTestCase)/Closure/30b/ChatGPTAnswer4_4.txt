The externs parameter might be unnecessary if it\'s not being used. Also, if there\'s no need to reference the NodeTraversal object after this line, the current approach is efficient. However, if there\'s any further operation required with this object, then it\'s better to hold a reference to it.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, it seems like there\'s an issue with the optimization or transformation of the JavaScript code.
