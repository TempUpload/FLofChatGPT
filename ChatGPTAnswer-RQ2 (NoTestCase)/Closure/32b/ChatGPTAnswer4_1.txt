The error message indicates a comparison failure in a unit test case. Specifically, the comparison between the expected and actual output is failing due to an unexpected space character after a newline. Based on this information, I\'ll analyze the code snippet provided in the first prompt and update the JSON object that describes the intended purpose of the function and potential bugs or suspicious code parts.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'extractMultilineTextualBlock\' is responsible for extracting a multi-line textual block from a stream of JsDoc tokens.

It\'s worth noting that without the complete code, it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact source of the discrepancy identified in the unit test. If you provide more context, I might be able to refine the analysis further.'}]
