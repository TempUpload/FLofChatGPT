This could be due to several reasons:\nThe type inference logic might be missing certain edge cases.\nThe way the type is being restricted or modified might not be capturing the full expected type.\nThe methods being used (like toMaybeFunctionType()) might have unexpected behaviors in certain cases.\nGiven only the error message and the specific function, it\'s challenging to pinpoint the exact cause without a broader context or without diving deep into the behaviors of the methods being invoked.'}]
