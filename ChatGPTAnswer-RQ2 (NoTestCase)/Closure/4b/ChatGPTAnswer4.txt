There might be context or additional logic outside this snippet that impacts its behavior.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message "expected:<[Parse error. Cycle detected in inheritance chain of type T]> but was:<[can only implement interfaces]>", it\'s clear there\'s an issue with type inheritance or implementation in the logic.\nConsidering the function resolveInternal from the provided code snippet and the error message, I can infer a couple of things. Here\'s the analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'resolveInternal\' appears to attempt resolving types using two mechanisms.

The function might not be detecting all possible cycles or could be failing to report them accurately.

It\'s essential to ensure that the superclass\'s logic doesn\'t conflict or produce unintended results, especially if there\'s custom behavior in this subclass."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe provided error message strongly points towards an issue in type inheritance or implementation, which seems to be related to the cycle detection logic in resolveInternal. The provided code snippet is limited in its scope, and without access to the complete code or the methods like detectImplicitPrototypeCycle, pinpointing the exact bug might require further exploration.'}]
