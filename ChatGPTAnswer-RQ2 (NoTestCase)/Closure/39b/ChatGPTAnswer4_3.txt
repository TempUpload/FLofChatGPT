It\'s essential, however, to also consider the wider context in which the function operates to understand the full implications and any potential mitigation strategies.', 'answer2': 'The error message provides a hint about the issue: a recursive record was expected to be represented as {loop: [?]}, but it is instead represented as {loop: [{...}]}. This suggests that the toStringHelper method is likely misrepresenting some recursive structures.\nWith the above understanding and the provided code, let\'s perform an updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'toStringHelper\' aims to return a string representation of the object.

It would be beneficial to look into the getPropertyType method and other related parts of the code to identify the exact root cause of the error.'}]
