It seems like the issue is related to the recursive representation of an object, where the test expects a different format.\nHere\'s the updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'toStringHelper\' is intended to convert an object\'s properties into a string representation.

In the provided code snippet, there is no clear indication of how recursive properties are handled, but the for-loop iterating through the object\'s properties (lines 362-367) and the subsequent construction of the string may be part of this. Therefore, the analysis focuses on these parts of the code.'}]
