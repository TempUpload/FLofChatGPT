Specifically, the error indicates that in some scenarios, a value of type (TwoNumbers|null) is being returned or assigned, where a value of type number or {first: number, second: number} was expected.\nWith that context in mind, let\'s analyze the initial code snippet.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function aims to get the declared JSType for a given source name, JSDoc information, left value (lValue), and right value (rValue).

It would be essential to ensure that the function\'s returned JSType always matches the expected type in all contexts it\'s used.'}]
