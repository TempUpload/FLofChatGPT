It seems the expected output has an extra VAR declaration that the actual output doesn\'t have.\nThe test testAssignWithCall appears to be failing because of the AST difference. Now, let\'s look back at the code snippet and determine which parts of the code could potentially lead to this discrepancy.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'recordAssignment\' is meant to record assignment-related information for nodes in the abstract syntax tree.
