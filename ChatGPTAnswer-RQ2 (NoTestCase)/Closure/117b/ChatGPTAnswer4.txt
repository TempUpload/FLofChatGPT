Depending on the external methods and their implementations, there might be other hidden issues not identified by this analysis.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message you provided, it seems that a test named "testIssue1047" in the TypeCheckTest class has failed.

Other points remain as potential issues, even if they don\'t directly relate to the error message.'}]
