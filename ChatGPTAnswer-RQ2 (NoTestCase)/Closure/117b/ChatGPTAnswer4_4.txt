The expected output was "...p never defined on C[2]", but the returned result was "...p never defined on C[3.c2_]".\nThis points to a potential discrepancy in how the function is climbing up the prototype chain or how it\'s resolving the type representation.\nJSON Analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function seems to be intended to get a human-readable name for a JavaScript type from a Node object.
