The expected behavior seems to preserve the property access style (a.b), while the actual result is generating a collapsed form (a$b).\nLet\'s re-analyze the function canCollapseUnannotatedChildNames from the initial code snippet to pinpoint potential locations that could contribute to this behavior:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function appears to determine if a given property or name can be collapsed when it is not annotated.
