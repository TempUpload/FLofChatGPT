This suggests that when the compiler traverses and analyzes the JavaScript nodes, it\'s running into a scenario where it didn\'t expect to encounter \'goog\'.\nWhile the function from the first prompt doesn\'t directly reference \'goog\', the methods it calls (like createNameInformation, recordSet, getName, etc.) could be indirectly responsible for generating or processing the \'goog\' variable. It would be ideal to also inspect the implementations and call chains of these methods in the broader context of the system.'}]
