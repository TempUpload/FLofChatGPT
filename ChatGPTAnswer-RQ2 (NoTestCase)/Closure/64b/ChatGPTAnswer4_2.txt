The function is designed to convert a Node object to its source representation. This is achieved by configuring a CodePrinter.Builder object with various options (pretty printing, line breaks, source mapping, etc.) and then building the source from it. The primary concerns arise from potential exceptions and potential null values when dealing with charsets.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, it seems that there\'s a discrepancy between an expected value of 17 and an observed value of -1.
