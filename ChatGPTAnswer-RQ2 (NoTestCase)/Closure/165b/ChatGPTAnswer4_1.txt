It\'s possible that it\'s a member variable of the enclosing class, but without the full context, it\'s hard to say if there are issues with its initialization or usage.\nThe \'RecordType\' constructor call is flagged because of the use of \'properties\'.

Given the additional context, debugging the test might offer more insight into the precise expectations and where the code might be falling short.'}]
