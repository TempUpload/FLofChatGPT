It\'s possible that there are no bugs, but the encapsulation may be redundant. However, without additional context or knowledge of what the function parseTypeName does or how JsDocToken is defined, it\'s hard to identify further potential issues.', 'answer2': 'Considering the error message and the provided code snippet, the error appears to be related to parsing type annotations in JavaScript documentation (JsDoc).

While the error could be originating from somewhere else in the code (like the actual content of the JsDoc comment or how other functions handle it), the provided snippet contains a direct call to parseTypeName, which is at the heart of the error.'}]
