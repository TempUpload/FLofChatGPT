With this in mind, the provided error message points to a potential formatting problem, especially around the handling of the value -0.0.\nLet\'s re-evaluate the provided code snippet from the first prompt in light of this new information.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `addNumber` is designed to format and add a double number `x` as a string.

Given the unit test error, it\'s likely that handling of values like -0.0 is central to the issue. The primary suspect is the way numbers are casted and then checked for equality, which can overlook nuances in floating-point representation.'}]
