While it\'s true that a simple number shouldn\'t start with a \'0\', the condition is problematic for a single-character string of \'0\', which should be allowed.', 'answer2': 'Given the additional error message, the error seems to be related to the handling of the numeric string \'0\'. The unit test error seems to be associated with a JavaScript code printing mechanism where the printed representation of the object is not matching the expected format. The difference is between using a number as a property key (0) versus a string ("0").\nHowever, based on the code snippet you initially provided, which simply checks if a string is a simple number, there\'s a mismatch in the function\'s behavior when dealing with the string \'0\'.\nRe-analyzing the function with this context:\nIntent of the Function:\nThe function isSimpleNumber is designed to check if a given string s represents a simple non-negative integer number.
