Actual faults or the absence of faults would depend on the wider context, the exact requirements, and the expected behavior of the code.', 'answer2': 'With the error message in mind, we can infer that the failure is related to a type-check test (com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue726).
