However, without the broader context of the program, some of these might not be actual issues. The findings need to be validated with the broader codebase and the intended behavior of the program.', 'answer2': 'Considering the new error message, it seems that the problem might be related to type resolution or string representation of types in the context of the goog.scope block.
