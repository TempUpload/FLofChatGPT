It\'s possible there are other definitions and methods outside this snippet, so the function might work correctly in a broader context, but based on the provided information, these are the potential problem areas.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, the problem seems to be a mismatch in expected and actual output regarding the placement of an arrow (^) character. The expected output contains the arrow under some whitespace, but the actual output does not. This discrepancy gives us a more specific indication of where to look for the bug in the code snippet from the first prompt.\nGiven the code\'s purpose of formatting error messages with an arrow indicating the error\'s position, it seems the error might be related to how the arrow is placed, especially at the end of the line.
