It\'s advisable to add null-checks or utilize Optional constructs to handle potential null values more gracefully. Additionally, before type casting, checking the type using instanceof can prevent potential ClassCastException issues.', 'answer2': 'Given the provided error message and focusing on the previously analyzed code snippet, it seems the error pertains to a failed assertion where a warning was expected but wasn\'t received.
