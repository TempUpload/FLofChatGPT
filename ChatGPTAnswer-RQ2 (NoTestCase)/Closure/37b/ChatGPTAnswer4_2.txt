An "INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR" often indicates a situation the compiler didn\'t expect, often triggered by code that\'s either malformed or uses features the compiler doesn\'t handle as expected.\nWith this in mind, let\'s revise our analysis of the provided code snippet in the requested JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function appears to traverse the given node \'n\', which is expected to represent a function node.

Given the presented code snippet and error, the best approach would be to cross-check with the broader codebase, specifically focusing on how nodes are represented and traversed.'}]
