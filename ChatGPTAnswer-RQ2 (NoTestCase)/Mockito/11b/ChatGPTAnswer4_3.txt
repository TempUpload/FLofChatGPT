This is problematic because when used in a hash-based collection (like HashMap or HashSet), all objects would end up in the same bucket, severely degrading the performance of lookups (making it essentially linear, O(n)). This could be considered a bug if the intent is to distribute different objects across different buckets in hash-based collections for efficient lookup."\n        }\n    ]\n}\nIt\'s worth noting that not all use cases of hashCode() require a distinct hash for each different object, but when used with collections like HashMap or HashSet, the above problem could arise.'}]
