Additionally, the sign of \'hoursOffset\' isn\'t taken into consideration when calculating \'hoursInMinutes\' (line 284), and the validity check for \'hoursOffset\' does not account for the valid value of -24 (line 276).', 'answer2': 'With the provided error message, the code analysis can be updated as follows:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'forOffsetHoursMinutes\' is intended to create a DateTimeZone object representing a time zone offset specified in hours and minutes.
