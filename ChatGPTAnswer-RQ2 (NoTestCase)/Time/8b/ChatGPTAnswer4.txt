This likely occurs during the processing of a negative hours offset, and indeed, the issue is with the manipulation of \'minutesOffset\' which was identified as a potential bug in the previous analysis. Thus, the bug is likely with lines 286 and 288.\nHere is the updated JSON response:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'forOffsetHoursMinutes\' takes two parameters: an hours offset and a minutes offset.
