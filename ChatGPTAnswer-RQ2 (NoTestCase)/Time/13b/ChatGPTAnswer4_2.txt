Originally, the comment was about a mathematical error in identifying integral numbers of seconds, but based on the error message, it\'s now clear that this line is likely failing to handle negative periods correctly, because it applies Math.abs to \'valueLong\' before checking whether it\'s a whole number of seconds. As a result, it\'s likely that this line is incorrectly treating negative periods as though they were positive.'}]
