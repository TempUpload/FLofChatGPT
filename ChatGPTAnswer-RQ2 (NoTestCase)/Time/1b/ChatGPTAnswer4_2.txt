If this is not the case, then the implementation might be correct, though it\'s rather unconventional.', 'answer2': 'Based on the given error message, the problem seems to be related to the method testConstructorEx7_TypeArray_intArray() in the class TestPartial_Constructors, but unfortunately, the error message does not provide specific details about how it is related to the compareTo() method.
