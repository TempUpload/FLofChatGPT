[{'answer1': 'The intent of this function appears to be to construct a new \'Partial\' object using the given arrays of \'DateTimeFieldType\' and corresponding integer values, as well as a provided \'Chronology\' object.

The issue of duplicates in the array has been highlighted which aligns with the problem stated in the error message. The rest of the entries remain unchanged as they still represent potential issues in the code.'}]
