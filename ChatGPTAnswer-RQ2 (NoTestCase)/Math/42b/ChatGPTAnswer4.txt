Additional analysis with the complete code and context might yield a more precise result.', 'answer2': 'Certainly! The given error message indicates an AssertionFailedError but doesn\'t provide a specific line number within the code snippet from the first prompt. Therefore, we have to infer the potential cause of the error based on the code itself.
