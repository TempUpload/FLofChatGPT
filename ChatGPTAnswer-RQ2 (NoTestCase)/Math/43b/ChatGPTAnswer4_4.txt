There may be further considerations that aren\'t visible from this snippet.', 'answer2': 'The error message "expected:<2.5> but was:<NaN>" suggests that somewhere in the execution of the unit test, the value expected to be 2.5 was instead NaN (Not a Number). Given that the error is related to the overriding of the mean, it\'s likely that the meanImpl is not calculating the mean correctly under certain conditions. We can suspect that the logic concerning meanImpl may be flawed.\nBased on the provided code snippet and the error message:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function seems to be designed to add a given \'value\' to various statistical calculations, such as sum, sum of squares, minimum, maximum, logarithmic sum, second moment, mean, variance, and geometric mean.
