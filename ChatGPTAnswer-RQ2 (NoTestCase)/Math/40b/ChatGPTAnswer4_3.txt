The error message indicates that the method computeObjectiveValue has been called more times than allowed (maximal count of 100). This suggests that there\'s a problem with the logic inside the doSolve() method that causes it to call computeObjectiveValue excessively.\nLet\'s create an updated JSON structure:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is meant to solve a given mathematical problem using the Brent\'s method.

In particular, the infinite loop at line 208 and multiple calls to computeObjectiveValue in the loop are suspicious and likely contribute to the TooManyEvaluationsException error. Adjustments to the loop condition or inner logic might be necessary to fix the issue.'}]
