It\'s worth noting that without additional context or seeing the complete codebase, the suggestions are based solely on the snippet provided.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, the problem appears to be an issue with checking whether the function values at the endpoints have different signs.

In numerical computing, using strict equality or inequality with floating-point numbers can be problematic. Instead, it might be more suitable to introduce a small tolerance value when checking if a number is effectively zero. This will account for small computational inaccuracies.'}]
