The error message highlights that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown because the function values at the endpoints do not have different signs. Specifically, one of the values is very close to zero (1.2246467991473532E-16), which is causing the issue.\nHere is the updated analysis in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'solve\' aims to find a root of a mathematical function in a given interval [min, max].

The code is not handling the scenario where one of the function values is very close to zero, causing the sign check to fail. This, in turn, leads to the IllegalArgumentException being thrown. The other issues remain the same but were not the cause of the reported error.'}]
