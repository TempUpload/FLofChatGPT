The most notable problem is the undefined variable zero. If this variable is defined elsewhere and is properly accessible, then that reduces the concern.', 'answer2': 'Based on the error message, the test is comparing two arrays of floating-point numbers, and the numbers at a particular index in those arrays differ slightly.
