The identified potential issues concern the assumptions made about the input values and the calculations of the t-statistic and the p-value. It would be a good idea to handle these cases gracefully, perhaps by throwing meaningful exceptions or checking preconditions.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message you provided, it seems there\'s an assertion failure in a test related to computing p-values near zero.
