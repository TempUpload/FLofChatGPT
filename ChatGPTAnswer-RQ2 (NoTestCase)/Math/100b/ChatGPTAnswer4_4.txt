Java\'s autoboxing feature can handle the conversion automatically.\nReusing the computed value of \'p\' is more efficient than calling \'problem.getAllParameters().length\' again.\nEven though a condition checks for the scenario where \'m <= p\', it\'s always good to make a note of potential division by zero cases.\nIf the covariance matrix contains negative diagonal values, the square root of these values would result in \'NaN\', which might not be expected or desired.'}]
