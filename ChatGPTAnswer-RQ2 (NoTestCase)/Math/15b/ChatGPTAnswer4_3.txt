Using a library function or utility whenever possible can reduce the risk of introducing bugs.', 'answer2': 'From the error message, the main hint we get is that the function returned 1.0 when -1.0 was expected. This means the function didn\'t handle certain inputs as intended. Given that the function is about computing powers, negative base numbers raised to certain powers can be a common source of errors, especially when dealing with even and odd exponents.\nWith that understanding, let\'s re-evaluate the given code snippet for potential bugs:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Computes the power of x raised to y, handling various edge cases of floating-point arithmetic.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1541,\n      "codeContent": "if (y >= TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -TWO_POWER_52) {",\n      "reason": "This condition might be causing an oversight for certain ranges of y.
