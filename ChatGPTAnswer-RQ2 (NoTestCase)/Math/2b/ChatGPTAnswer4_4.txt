If getPopulationSize() does return zero, then the division in this function will throw an arithmetic exception.', 'answer2': 'Given the new error message, we can update our analysis for the code snippet provided:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to compute and return the numerical mean using the formula: (sample size * number of successes) / population size.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 268,\n      "codeContent": "return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();",\n      "reason": "Potential division by zero.

Given the error message showing a negative sample size, it is possible that the computation of the formula is resulting in unintended negative values, which might be due to the values returned by getSampleSize() and/or getNumberOfSuccesses().'}]
