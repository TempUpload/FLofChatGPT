However, without further context on the PoissonDistributionImpl class and its intended usage, it\'s difficult to provide more specific fault localization. The points mentioned are based on the code snippet and general knowledge of Poisson and normal distributions.', 'answer2': 'The error message you\'ve provided points to an exception being thrown from the code snippet you shared earlier.
