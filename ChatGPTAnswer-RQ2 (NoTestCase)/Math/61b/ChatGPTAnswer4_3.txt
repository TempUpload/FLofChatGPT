Thus, the condition at line 93 could potentially be an over-restriction.\nUsing a normal distribution to approximate a Poisson distribution is a standard practice when the mean is large. However, if the mean is 0, there may be some potential issues with this approximation.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message provided, it seems that the provided code snippet does have a bug, specifically regarding the exception thrown when the Poisson mean is not positive. The error message clearly states that the mean is -1, which should indeed throw an error, but the exception message is slightly misleading since it claims the Poisson mean must be "positive," when in reality, it should allow for 0 as a valid mean.\nHere\'s an updated JSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function appears to be a constructor for the PoissonDistributionImpl class.
