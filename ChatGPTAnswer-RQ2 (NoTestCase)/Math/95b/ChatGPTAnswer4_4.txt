The primary concerns are the potential for division by zero and the non-use of the declared variable.', 'answer2': 'Considering the error message, it seems that there\'s an issue related to the calculation of the initial domain which can potentially become negative (indicated by initial=-1.0 in the error), especially when the denominator degrees of freedom are less than or equal to 2.0.
