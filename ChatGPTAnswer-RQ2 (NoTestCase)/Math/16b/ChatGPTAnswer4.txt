This results in Infinity and fails the test that expects 0.0. The other potential concerns remain the same as before. The solution might involve introducing additional logic or checks to handle very large values of x to avoid this overflow and ensure the expected result is returned.'}, {'answer1': 'Let\'s analyze the provided code snippet.
