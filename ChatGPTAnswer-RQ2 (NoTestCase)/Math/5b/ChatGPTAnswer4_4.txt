To confirm these, it would be best to see the complete implementation of the class and test the function in different scenarios.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and the code snippet from the first prompt, it seems the issue lies with the computation of the reciprocal for a complex number when its real and imaginary parts are both zero.\nHere\'s the updated analysis of the code:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to compute the reciprocal of a complex number.

It currently returns NaN, but based on the test error, it should return a representation of infinity (like (Infinity, Infinity)).'}]
