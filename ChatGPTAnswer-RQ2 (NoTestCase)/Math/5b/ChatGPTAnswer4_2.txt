The expected behavior is to return (NaN, NaN) when attempting to compute the reciprocal of a zero complex number, but the code currently returns (Infinity, Infinity).\nWith this additional context, let\'s update the JSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'reciprocal\' intends to compute and return the reciprocal of a complex number, taking into account several special cases such as NaN (Not a Number), zero, and infinite values.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 305,\n      "codeContent": "return NaN;",\n      "reason": "The symbol \'NaN\' is not defined in this context.
