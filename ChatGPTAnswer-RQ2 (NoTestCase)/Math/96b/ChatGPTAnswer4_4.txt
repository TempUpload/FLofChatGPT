Good equals methods generally pair with a proper hashCode method to ensure consistent behavior with Java collections.\nEnsure that isNaN() is a valid method in the Complex class and behaves as expected.\nThe function uses Double.doubleToRawLongBits for equality comparison. This can correctly compare NaN values and +0.0/-0.0, but ensure it\'s consistent with the desired behavior for this class.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message you provided, it appears that the error is stemming from an equality comparison between two Complex objects.

The use of bitwise comparison in line 258 can also be potentially problematic, especially for floating point numbers.'}]
