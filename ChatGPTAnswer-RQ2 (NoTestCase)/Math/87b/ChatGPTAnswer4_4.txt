If more than one non-zero entry is found, the function returns null. Otherwise, it returns the row index of the non-zero entry or null if none is found.\nJSON Analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Determine the row index in a matrix column (from a specific starting point) that contains a non-zero entry.
