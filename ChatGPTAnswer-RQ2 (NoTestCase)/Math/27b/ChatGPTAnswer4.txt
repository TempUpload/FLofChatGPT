The primary concern here is that we can\'t guarantee the correctness of the multiply method without seeing its implementation. If the function belongs to a class that has this method and the method does what we expect, then this code may be correct. However, without this context, it\'s highlighted as potentially buggy.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the provided code snippet, we can infer that there\'s a potential problem related to numerical calculations.
