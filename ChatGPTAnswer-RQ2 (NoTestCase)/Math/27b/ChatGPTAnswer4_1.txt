The main concern stems from the unknown nature of the multiply method. Without understanding its behavior or seeing its implementation, it\'s hard to ascertain if it contains bugs or not.', 'answer2': 'Given the additional context provided by the error message, we can attempt a more informed fault localization of the code snippet.
