Given that the error occurred at line 190 of the DiscreteDistribution.sample method, we can deduce that the issue arises when the function tries to store a value in the array out that isn\'t of type T.\nJSON Analysis Update:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to generate an array of samples of type T, of the specified size.
