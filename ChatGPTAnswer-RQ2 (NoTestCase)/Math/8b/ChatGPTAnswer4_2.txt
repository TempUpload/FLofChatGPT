Here\'s the updated JSON:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to return an array of samples with a specified size.

The analysis highlights the most suspicious parts of the code that could be causing the problem. The actual solution might require ensuring type consistency throughout the code.'}]
