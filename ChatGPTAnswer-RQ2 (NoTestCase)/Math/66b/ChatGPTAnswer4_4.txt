The function starts at an initial guess (mid) and then iteratively refines the estimate until a termination condition is met or until the maximum iteration count is exceeded.\nFault Localization:\nThe following are areas of concern or potential bugs:\nLine Number: 99-104\nCode Content:\njava\nCopy code\nif (eps <= 0) {\n    throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException(eps);\n}\nif (t <= 0) {\n    throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException(t);\n}\nReason: These conditions are checking if eps and t are non-positive and then throw exceptions.
