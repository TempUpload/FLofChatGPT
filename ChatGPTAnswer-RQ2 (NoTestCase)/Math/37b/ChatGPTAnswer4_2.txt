The error message provided indicates a failure in a test for the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) for a complex number, where the expected result was 1.0, but NaN was returned instead.\nGiven that the error is about the tanh function and the provided code snippet implements the tangent function (tan), there may be an inconsistency between the test and the provided code snippet.
