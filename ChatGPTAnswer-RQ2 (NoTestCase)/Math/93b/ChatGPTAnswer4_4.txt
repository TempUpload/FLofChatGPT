(17 factorial) computed by the function did not match the expected value. The difference between the expected and actual value seems to be on the scale of \n10\n5\n (at the fifth decimal point).

If the result is too large to fit into a long variable, an ArithmeticException is thrown.\nIdentifying potential issues:\nLine 345: The function calls factorialDouble(n), which is presumably supposed to calculate the factorial of \nn in double precision. The resulting double is then rounded to a long. If factorialDouble(n) computes \nn! with even a tiny relative error, the rounding could introduce a significant absolute error, especially for large values of \nn like 17.\nLine 350: The function is returning factorials[n]. However, factorials is not defined in the given code snippet. We don\'t know how it\'s populated. If the value at factorials[n] is not the factorial of \nn, the function will return an incorrect result.\nLine 345: The check for Long.MAX_VALUE doesn\'t seem directly related to the current error but is a potential pitfall. A value just below Long.MAX_VALUE could still be a valid factorial, and the current logic would miss it.\nLine 350: There\'s a risk of an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if \nn is negative or if \nn exceeds the length of the factorials array.\nGeneral: The function seems to calculate the factorial in two different ways: first by calling factorialDouble(n) and then by accessing an array factorials[n].
