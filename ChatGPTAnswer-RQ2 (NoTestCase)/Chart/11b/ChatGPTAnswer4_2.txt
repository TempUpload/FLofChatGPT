The AssertionFailedError you received could be due to the identified bug at line 275, where the iterator for p2 is incorrectly being created from p1. This mistake would cause the function to erroneously compare p1 with itself instead of comparing p1 with p2, which is likely leading to the failed assertions during the unit test.'}]
