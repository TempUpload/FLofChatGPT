This could be a mistake or just unused parameters, depending on the wider context. In any case, it\'s good to be aware of this to ensure clean and understandable code.\nPlease note that without the full context of the surrounding code, this analysis might not cover all possible bugs. It\'s recommended to consider this analysis as a part of a broader debugging process.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, it seems the issue is about an unexpected color value.
