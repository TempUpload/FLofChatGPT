Certain safeguards or checks may be in place in other parts of your program that could prevent these exceptions from happening. It\'s recommended to inspect each reported potential issue carefully and understand the overall code logic before making any changes.', 'answer2': 'The provided error message indicates that a new Range object is being constructed with the lower limit being greater than the upper limit. In this context, the negative value (-2.3000000000000007) is being used as the upper limit, and this is causing the IllegalArgumentException. This typically happens when an object\'s dimensions are calculated incorrectly, resulting in negative values.\nLooking at the provided code snippet, this can happen in a couple of places where we subtract the heights or widths of the blocks from the constraints\' dimensions.
