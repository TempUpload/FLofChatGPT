[{'answer1': 'Based on the given code snippet, it appears that the intention of the function \'getShortClassName\' is to return the short form of the given class name, by stripping off the package prefix, if any. In addition, if the class name refers to an inner class, the code is meant to replace the dollar sign (\'$\') used to separate the enclosing class name from the inner class name with a dot (\'.\').
