It seems to be a simple function intended to check if a given object is registered in a certain registry by checking if the object is a key in a certain map.\nHowever, potential problems might arise based on the usage and the state of the map. Therefore, without the context of the rest of the code (especially how the getRegistry() function works), it is impossible to make concrete assertions.
