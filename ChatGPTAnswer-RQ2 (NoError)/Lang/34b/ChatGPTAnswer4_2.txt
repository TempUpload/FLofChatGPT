However, it\'s often best to avoid these types of potential race conditions, especially when working in a multithreaded environment.

Therefore, the earlier analysis of the potential issues within the getRegistry() method still holds. As such, the analysis of the potential issues in the getRegistry() method does not change. However, it\'s worth noting that your unit test may exhibit behaviors that are related to how getRegistry() functions.
