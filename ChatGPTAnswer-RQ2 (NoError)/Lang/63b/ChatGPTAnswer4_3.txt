[{'answer1': 'Based on the given code snippet, it appears to be a function that formats a time period between two given timestamps based on a certain format string, possibly allowing for padding with zeros and different time zones. This function seems to deal with calculating the differences between various units of time such as milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, and years, and then adjusts these differences to ensure none are negative.
