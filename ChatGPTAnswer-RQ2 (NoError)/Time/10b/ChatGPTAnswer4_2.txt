The line number, the actual code content, and the reason explaining why the location is potentially buggy are all included for each bug.', 'answer2': 'After analyzing the function and the unit tests together, the purpose of the function seems to remain the same, i.e., to calculate the difference between two ReadablePartial instances in terms of a provided ReadablePeriod. The unit test cases indicate that the function should be able to handle MonthDay instances correctly, including the special case of February 29th in leap years. However, the potential issues identified in the function remain the same.
