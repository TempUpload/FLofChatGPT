The constructor accepts an array of DateTimeFieldType instances, an array of corresponding integer values, and a Chronology instance. The function ensures the types and values arrays are not null and have the same length, that the types array does not contain null elements or out-of-order elements, and that the types and values arrays are stored as properties of the object.
