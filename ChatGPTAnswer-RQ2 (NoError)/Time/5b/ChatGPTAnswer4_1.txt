[{'answer1': 'The function seems to normalize a given period to standard units (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years) by converting all the time units into milliseconds and creating a new Period object. Afterward, it treats years and months separately, as these units cannot be represented uniformly in terms of milliseconds.

If the PeriodType consists of months, weeks, and days, it will adjust the Period to ensure the values fall into these units.
