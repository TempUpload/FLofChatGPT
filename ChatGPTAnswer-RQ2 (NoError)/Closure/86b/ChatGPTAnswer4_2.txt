This distinction seems to be made based on the syntax tree node type and the results of the supplied predicate function locals.\nThe test cases outline that "names", function calls, this, arguments, object instantiation, and property references are considered non-local. However, primitive values such as null, undefined, Infinity, NaN, numeric and string literals, boolean values, and empty arrays are all considered local.\nHere is the JSON analysis after taking into account the test cases:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function seems to be used to evaluate whether the value represented by a given syntax tree Node is considered \'local\' or not. Local values here mean primitive values and objects that do not have any aliases. Non-local values are typically those that involve function calls, properties, object instantiation, \'this\', \'arguments\', and general names or identifiers.
