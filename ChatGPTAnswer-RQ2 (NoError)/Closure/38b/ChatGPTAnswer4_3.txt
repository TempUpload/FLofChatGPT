Let\'s analyze the original code snippet again, keeping in mind the context provided by the new unit test case. The test case, although not to be analyzed itself, can give some insights into the expected behavior, specifically related to negative zero.\nHere\'s the updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'addNumber\' takes a double value \'x\' and converts it into a specific string representation, handling cases like negative numbers, negative zeros, and scientific notation.
