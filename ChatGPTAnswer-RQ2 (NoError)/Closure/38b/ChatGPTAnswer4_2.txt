[{'answer1': 'The intent of this function seems to be converting a given double number into a string and appending it to some existing string or buffer, possibly in a pretty-printing context. If the number is an integer and greater than 100, it seems to represent it in scientific notation, where the mantissa is the most significant digit of the number, and the exponent is the number of times we can divide it by 10 before it becomes less than the original value. If the number is less than 100, it is directly converted into a string.

When the number is a whole number and greater than 100, the function attempts to represent it in scientific notation. If the number is less than 100, it is directly converted into a string. For non-zero decimal numbers, the function directly converts them into a string as well.
