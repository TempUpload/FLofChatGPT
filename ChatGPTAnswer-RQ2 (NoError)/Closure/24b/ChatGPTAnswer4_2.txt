The test cases provided in the unit test are expected to cause a failure as per the logic of the \'findAliases\' function, which reports an error if the conditions for aliasing are not met. This is consistent with the error reporting present in the \'findAliases\' function, and no new potential bugs are identified when considering the unit test.'}]
