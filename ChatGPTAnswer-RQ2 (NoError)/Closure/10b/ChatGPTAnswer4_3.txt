[{'answer1': 'Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the function mayBeString is used to evaluate whether a certain node (n) could be a string or not, considering recursion as an optional parameter.

Further information about these helper functions would enable a more comprehensive analysis.\nIf the mayBeString function is not working as expected in certain scenarios (e.g., passing or failing certain unit tests), this might indicate potential bugs. But for a precise bug localization, more context is necessary.'}]
