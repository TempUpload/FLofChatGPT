[{'answer1': 'Here\'s my analysis:\nThe function extractMultilineTextualBlock seems to be part of a parser for JSDoc comments.

This function extracts a multi-line block of text from the comments based on the given token and whitespace option. This multi-line text is then packaged into an ExtractionInfo object.\nThe unit test case provided gives us more context about the usage of the extractMultilineTextualBlock function. The test case, testParsePreserve, verifies that the comment parsing works correctly when the "@preserve" annotation is used. The JSDoc comment is parsed and the preserved content should be retrieved accurately.\nAfter examining the original code snippet along with the provided unit test case, my analysis remains similar with the following suspicious parts of the code:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'extractMultilineTextualBlock\' is part of a parser for JSDoc comments.
