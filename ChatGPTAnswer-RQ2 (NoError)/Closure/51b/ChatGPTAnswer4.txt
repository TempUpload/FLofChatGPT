[{'answer1': 'The intended purpose of the provided code snippet seems to be:\nThe addNumber function takes a double value \'x\' as input, determines if it\'s an integer or not, then converts this number into a string representation. It\'s also doing some pretty formatting, converting larger numbers into scientific notation (e.g., 1000 would be 1E3) if the exponent part is greater than 2. It also takes care of handling negative values, adding a space between the number and the preceding minus sign to avoid misparsing.\nThe potential issues in the code could be as follows:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'addNumber\' takes a double as input and formats it to a string representation for further processing or display.
