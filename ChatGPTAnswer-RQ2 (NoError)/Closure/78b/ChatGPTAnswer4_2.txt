The unit tests you\'ve provided would help ensure the function correctly folds constants in mathematical expressions. This does not change the function\'s purpose.\nThe unit tests don\'t reveal any new potential bugs in the code snippet. However, they can help us understand the function better and confirm some of the potential issues identified earlier.
