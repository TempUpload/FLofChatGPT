The bugs mentioned here are more about potential improvements for robustness and clarity.', 'answer2': 'The given code still seems to be a function from a Java program which checks if a given character c is a whitespace character and returns a TernaryValue object accordingly.\nThe unit test you provided doesn\'t directly test the isStrWhiteSpaceChar function.
