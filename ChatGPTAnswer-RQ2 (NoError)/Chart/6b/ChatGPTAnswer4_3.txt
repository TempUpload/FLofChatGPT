The function returns true if the object being compared is the same as the current instance or if it is an instance of ShapeList, the superclass\'s equals method is used for comparison. This suggests that ShapeList class extends a superclass with a specific equals method implementation.

The equals method should be comparing the properties of ShapeList instances, but this implementation is entirely dependent on the superclass method, which may not be properly overridden.
