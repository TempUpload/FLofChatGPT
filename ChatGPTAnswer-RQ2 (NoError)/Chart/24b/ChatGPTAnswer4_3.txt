However, the addition of unit tests has clarified that the function is intended to treat values less than \'lowerBound\' as black, and values more than \'upperBound\' as white. This matches the clamping behavior of lines 124 and 125, and so those lines are now less likely to be problematic. It also reveals that \'lowerBound\' and \'upperBound\' are probably meant to be 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. The analysis of the function\'s intent and potential issues has been updated accordingly.'}]
