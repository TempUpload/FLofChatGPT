However, the actual implementation simply calculates the cross product without this preconditioning.', 'answer2': 'Let\'s analyze the crossProduct function once again, considering the unit test case provided:\nFrom the unit test, the function Vector3D.crossProduct is supposed to calculate the cross product of two vectors, which is already established.
