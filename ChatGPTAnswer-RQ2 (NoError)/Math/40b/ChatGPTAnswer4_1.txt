The issues listed could be potential bugs if the variables are not initialized, defined, or handled correctly elsewhere in the code.', 'answer2': 'Based on the additional context you\'ve provided with the unit test case, it appears the variables \'maximalOrder\', \'allowed\', and \'MAXIMAL_AGING\' are likely defined elsewhere in the code and not within the \'doSolve()\' function. As such, they may not be bugs but design choices, likely defined as class variables or constants.\nGiven this, the analysis of the code snippet remains largely the same.
