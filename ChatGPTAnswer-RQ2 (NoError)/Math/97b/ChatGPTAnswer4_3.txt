Even though you\'ve added a unit test, the analysis of the main function code snippet doesn\'t change. The test does, however, confirm the suspicion that the endpoint values (i.e., roots) need to be handled properly within the function\'s logic as identified in the \'faultLocalization\' for line 138.'}]
