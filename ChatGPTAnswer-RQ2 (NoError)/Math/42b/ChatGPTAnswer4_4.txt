It then initializes a set of basic rows and an array of coefficients based on the original number of decision variables. For each decision variable, it finds its corresponding column index, and checks if it has a basic row.

Specifically, it seems the function should ensure that all coefficients are non-negative. The mentioned issues might affect this property, especially the handling of negative column indices and potential inconsistencies with the restrictToNonNegative variable.'}]
