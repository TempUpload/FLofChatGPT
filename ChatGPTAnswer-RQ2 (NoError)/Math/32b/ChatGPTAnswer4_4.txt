The provided test seems to deal with 3D vertices to represent a polygon in 3D space, while the original code deals with a 2D representation. However, the original analysis should still be applicable since we\'re focusing exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt.\nHere\'s the updated JSON:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'computeGeometricalProperties\' aims to compute geometrical properties of a 2D shape, which could be a polygon.
