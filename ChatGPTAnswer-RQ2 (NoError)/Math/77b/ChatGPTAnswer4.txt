The unit test case further confirms the expected behavior of the getLInfNorm method, which should return the maximum absolute value from the vector (as represented by the entries iterator), rather than summing all the values. This is evidenced by the test case assertion on line 968 that compares the result of v5.getLInfNorm() to 6.0, which seems to be the maximum absolute value in the vec5 vector.'}]
