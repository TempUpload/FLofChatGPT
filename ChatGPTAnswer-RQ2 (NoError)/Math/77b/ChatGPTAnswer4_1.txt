[{'answer1': 'The function getLInfNorm seems intended to calculate the L-Infinity norm (or maximum absolute value) of an array data. However, there seems to be a bug in line 721, which can lead to incorrect results. The L-Infinity norm is the maximum absolute value in a vector, not the sum of all the maximum values.
