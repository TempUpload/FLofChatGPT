The provided unit test case seems to be targeting the code snippet from the previous prompt and is designed to test the optimization of a function that combines a sine wave and a step function. However, the instructions ask to focus exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, so I\'ll provide an updated analysis of that code, keeping the context of the unit test in mind.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This code snippet defines a univariate optimization algorithm to find the minimum or maximum value of a given function within a specified range.
