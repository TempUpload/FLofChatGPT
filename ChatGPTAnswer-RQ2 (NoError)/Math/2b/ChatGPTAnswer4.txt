Also, the intended purpose of this function might be different depending on the overall context in the program.', 'answer2': 'Here\'s an updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `getNumericalMean` seems to compute the numerical mean in the context of a hypergeometric distribution, which can be used in statistical significance tests.

If there are safeguards ensuring that getSampleSize(), getNumberOfSuccesses(), and getPopulationSize() always return non-null and valid values, and that getPopulationSize() never returns zero, then these potential issues may not exist.'}]
