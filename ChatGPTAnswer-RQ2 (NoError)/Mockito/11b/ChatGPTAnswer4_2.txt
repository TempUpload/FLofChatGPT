This implementation undermines the general contract of \'hashCode\' in Java, which states that if two objects are not equal according to their \'equals\' method, it\'s highly desirable to generate different hash codes for these objects. Thus, returning a constant hash code will potentially cause performance issues when this object is used in a hash-based collection like \'HashSet\', \'HashMap\', etc. because all objects will end up in the same hash bucket, leading to a worst-case time complexity of O(n) for operations that should be O(1)."\n    }\n  ]\n}'}]
