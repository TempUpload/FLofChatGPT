Hash functions should return different values for different objects (except in rare circumstances where two distinct objects are considered equal according to their \'equals()\' method). This implementation will lead to poor performance for hash-based collections, as all instances will be placed in the same hash bucket, resulting in a linear time complexity for operations that should ideally have constant time complexity."\n    }\n]\n}'}]
