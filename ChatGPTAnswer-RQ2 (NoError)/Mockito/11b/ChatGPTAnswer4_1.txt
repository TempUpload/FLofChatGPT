It also violates the general contract of `hashCode` which requires that if two objects are equal according to the `equals(Object)` method, then calling the `hashCode` method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe main issue with the given code is that it always returns a constant hash code, which can severely degrade the performance of hash-based collections and also potentially violate the contract between hashCode and equals.'}]
