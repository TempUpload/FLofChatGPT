[{'answer1': 'The purpose of this function seems to be to verify certain conditions on some data using a delegate object, handling errors properly and controlling the flow using a timer object.\nThe function might have a few issues, let\'s list them in the JSON format as requested:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function appears to use a delegate to verify some conditions on the input data (VerificationData).
