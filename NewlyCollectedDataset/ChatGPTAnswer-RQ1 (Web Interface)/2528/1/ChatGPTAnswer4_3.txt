Entering a non-integer value will result in a runtime exception (java.util.InputMismatchException).\nThe Math.pow(2,n) calculation can lead to overflow or imprecision for large values of n.\nThe Scanner object is not closed after usage, which is generally not a good practice, although less critical for a short-lived program.'}]
