This could lead to an InputMismatchException if the user enters non-integer input.\nLine 6: The variable N is initialized to 0 but is immediately overwritten by the user input. This initialization is redundant.\nLine 11: Although not technically incorrect, the code does not account for potential overflow or underflow when calculating 2^N. It would be safer to include a check for the range of N to prevent such issues.'}]
