Using raw types bypasses these safety checks.\nLine 12: The \'strings\' array is declared but not utilized, making it unnecessary.\nLines 14 & 15: Using an index-based for loop and an iterator simultaneously can be risky. If for some reason the set\'s size changes while iterating, this can lead to unexpected behavior or even a NoSuchElementException.'}]
