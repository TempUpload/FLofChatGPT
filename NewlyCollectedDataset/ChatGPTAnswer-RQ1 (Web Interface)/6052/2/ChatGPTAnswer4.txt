If \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\' are intended to be the first, second, and third terms, then \'i\' should start from 1 to calculate the 20190324th term correctly.\nThe second point relates to the absence of any comments or documentation explaining the mathematical or logical reason behind using modulo 10000. If this is important to the algorithm, documentation should be present to clarify its role.\nLastly, the output printed to the console lacks context. The purpose or meaning of the variable \'d\' is not clear from this single output.'}]
