It should be \'door[j] = !door[j];\' to toggle the state of every ith door."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe code intends to solve a famous problem where there are 100 doors in a hallway. Initially, all doors are opened. Then for every ith door starting from the 2nd door, the state of every ith door is toggled (i.e., if it\'s open, it\'s closed, and if it\'s closed, it\'s opened). At the end of this exercise, only the doors whose numbers are perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16,..., 100) remain opened. The logic in the provided code, however, is incorrect due to the faulty line highlighted above.'}]
