The function then toggles the state of doors in multiple passes. In the first pass, every door\'s state is toggled. In the second pass, every second door\'s state is toggled, and so on. In the final pass, only the 100th door\'s state is toggled. After all the passes, the function prints the numbers of the doors that are closed.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 7,\n      "codeContent": "for(k=0;k<100;k+=j){",\n      "reason": "The loop starts at index 0, but arrays in Java are 0-based.

The most significant potential bug is the starting index in the inner loop. The inconsistency can lead to logical errors.'}]
