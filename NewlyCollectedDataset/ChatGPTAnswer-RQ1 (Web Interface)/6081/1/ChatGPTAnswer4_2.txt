It\'s unclear why it\'s being read from input.\nThe condition inside the while loop checks if k is greater than or equal to n. Given that n is the number of integers to be read and it\'s decrementing within the loop, it\'s unclear why we are making this comparison. It\'s possible that the author meant to compare k with height instead of n.'}]
