However, the value could be a whole number.

To get accurate results, one of the operands in num / 2 should be cast to a double.\nThe second issue is that the code prints \'0.5000000000\' for even numbers. This is inconsistent with the way the output is calculated for odd numbers.\nThe third issue is that the code formats the output to 10 decimal places, even when the output could be a whole number. This could be unnecessary or misleading.'}]
