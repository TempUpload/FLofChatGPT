If this value is not supposed to be hardcoded, this could be a bug."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe code is relatively simple, and it seems to achieve its intended purpose of printing a hardcoded number. However, it\'s worth noting that hardcoding numbers or strings like this could be problematic depending on the broader context of the application. Therefore, I\'ve included that as a potential point of concern.'}]
