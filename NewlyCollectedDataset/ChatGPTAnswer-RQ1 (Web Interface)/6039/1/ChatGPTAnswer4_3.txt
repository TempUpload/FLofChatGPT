The grid (or map) is represented as a 2D array, where \'0\' indicates a passable cell and non-zero values indicate obstacles. The algorithm starts from the top-left corner (0, 0) and aims to reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1). The path is represented using the directions \'U\' (Up), \'D\' (Down), \'L\' (Left), and \'R\' (Right).
