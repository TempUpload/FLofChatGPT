While it isn\'t a bug per se, leaving commented-out debug code in production can be confusing."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nFurther notes:\nThe logic allows for multiple conditions to be true simultaneously, e.g., a triangle can be both isosceles and right-angled. However, because of the structure of the if-else conditions after the loop, the last condition that evaluates to true will overwrite the flag variable. This behavior can lead to inaccurate results.\nThe logic for checking a valid triangle is correct. However, the logic for the different types of triangles should be structured to avoid potential overrides, especially if the commented \'break\' statements remain commented out.'}]
