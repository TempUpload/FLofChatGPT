Instead, the maximum powers of 3, 5, and 7 that don\'t exceed \'tar\' should be precomputed.\nThe repeated usage of Math.pow method within the nested loops is inefficient. It\'s better to precompute the powers and store them in a data structure, or to multiply the previous value by 3, 5, or 7 respectively, which will significantly reduce the computation time.\nThe Scanner object declared on line 5 is not being used anywhere in the code, which might indicate unused code or a missing feature.'}]
