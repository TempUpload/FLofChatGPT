If there\'s a possibility that no valid pairs of factors could be found, this value will be misleading when printed out as the result.\nProper input validation is a best practice. The program doesn\'t check if the provided input is a valid long number.\nThe loop checks for factors using the square root of k, but doesn\'t validate if k is positive. The sqrt of a negative number in the context of Java will return NaN (not a number), which would make the loop condition incorrect.'}]
