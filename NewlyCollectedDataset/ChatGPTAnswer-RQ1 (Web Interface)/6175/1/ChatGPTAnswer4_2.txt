It might be more accurate to initialize it with Long.MAX_VALUE.\nIn line 11, the loop condition has i <= tar, where i is an integer and tar is a double. This can introduce inaccuracies due to type mismatch. It\'s recommended to cast tar to an integer or use a separate integer variable for the comparison.'}]
