If 0 is ever a meaningful value in the computation, this could be problematic.\nThe logic assumes villages are in a sorted order without any code or comments indicating this assumption. If they\'re not sorted, calculations might be invalid.\nVariable naming inconsistency can lead to future bugs if the code is ever modified.\nIncrementing the final result might be intentional, but it\'s unclear without comments or context, so it\'s worth checking.'}]
