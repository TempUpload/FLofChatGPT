This could result in a logical error.\nLine 25 calculates \'min\' without checking if either array is empty, risking an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\nLine 11 reads \'n\' but doesn\'t validate that it is a positive integer.\nLine 12 reads \'m\' but also doesn\'t validate that it is a positive integer.'}]
