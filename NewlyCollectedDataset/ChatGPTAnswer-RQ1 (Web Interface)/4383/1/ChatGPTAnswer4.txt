If the sequence doesn\'t end with a space, the last word\'s length will be printed on a new line due to System.out.println(a).\nFor every word\'s length, the code appends a comma. Even for the last word in the sequence, it appends a comma which isn\'t ideal.\nLastly, there is no check for an empty input string, which would lead the code to print \'0\' as output.'}]
