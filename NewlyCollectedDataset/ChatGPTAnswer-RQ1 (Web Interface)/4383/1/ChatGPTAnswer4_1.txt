This may be problematic if you are looking for consistent formatting.\nLine 20: The length of the last word is printed on a new line, which is inconsistent with the format of the previous word lengths that are separated by commas on the same line.\nLine 9: There is no check for an empty input string or any other invalid input types, which might lead to unexpected behavior.\nLine 13: The code only separates words based on spaces. It treats all non-space characters (including punctuation marks) as parts of words, which may or may not be intended behavior.\nLine 8: Though not closing the Scanner object may not lead to a resource leak in this specific scenario (since the program is quite small and exits shortly after), it\'s generally a good practice to close resources.'}]
