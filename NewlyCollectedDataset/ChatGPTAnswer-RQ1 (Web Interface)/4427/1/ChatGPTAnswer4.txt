The calc() method populates the arr with values such that any non-zero value at an index indicates that the index is a prime number. In the main() method, the program repeatedly asks for a number \'n\' from the user and counts how many prime numbers are less than or equal to \'n\'.\nThere are potential inefficiencies and minor issues in the code, as mentioned in the JSON output.'}]
