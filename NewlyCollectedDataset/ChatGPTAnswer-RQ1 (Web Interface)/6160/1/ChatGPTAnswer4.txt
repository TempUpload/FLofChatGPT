While this is an effective way to avoid recomputation, the use of \'int\' data type can lead to overflow.\nThe size of the array is larger than needed. Although this is not a critical issue, it may lead to inefficient memory usage.\nThere is no validation for the input \'n\'. If the user enters a value less than or equal to 0, the program might not behave as expected.\nSetting the value of f[2] can lead to an exception if \'n\' is less than 2.\nIt\'s a good practice to close resources like Scanner to avoid potential resource leaks.'}]
