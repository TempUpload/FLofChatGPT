There might be a mathematical formula to solve this more efficiently.\nThe most suspicious line is where it checks if \'sum\' is divisible by 5 and is not zero, because of the decrement operations happening prior to it. The logic seems overly complicated for what it\'s trying to achieve.\nThe loop upper bound might be arbitrary. Without additional context, it\'s hard to judge whether this bound is appropriate.'}]
