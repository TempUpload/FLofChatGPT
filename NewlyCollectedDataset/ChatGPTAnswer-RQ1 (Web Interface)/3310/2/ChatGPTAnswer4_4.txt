This can produce unexpected results when recursively calling \'func\'."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 9,\n      "codeContent": "n = cin.nextInt();",\n      "reason": "The global static variable \'n\' is being set here, which can affect the behavior of the \'func\' method if called from elsewhere.
