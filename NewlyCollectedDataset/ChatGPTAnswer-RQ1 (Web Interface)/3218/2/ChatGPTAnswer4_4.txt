However, for a string to be \'almost palindrome\', there should be exactly one pair of characters that are different. If there are more, it won\'t be an \'almost palindrome\' even if \'diff\' is 1.

However, it doesn\'t guarantee that the rest of the characters form a palindrome. This will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.'}]
