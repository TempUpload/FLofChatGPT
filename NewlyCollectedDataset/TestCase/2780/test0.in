Notes on upgrading to MS-DOS 6
==============================

If you have OS/2 on your computer, and the MICROSOFT
MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE referred you to the OS2.TXT
file, carry out the following procedure that corresponds
to your computer's configuration. 

If You Have Neither OS/2 Dual Boot Nor OS/2 Boot Manager
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to remove OS/2 from your computer but want 
to save the data on your hard disk first, carry out the 
following procedure:

To remove OS/2 and save the data on your computer:

1. Restart your computer using OS/2.

2. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy 
   disks by using the COPY command.

   CAUTION Do not remove OS/2 system files from your hard disk.

3. Reinsert Setup Disk 1 in drive A (the startup drive).

4. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

5. When Setup displays the screen about a non-MS-DOS partition
   or non-MS-DOS files, choose to remove the partition or files.

6. After you finish setting up MS-DOS, copy the data files 
   you saved in step 2 from the floppy disks back to your 
   hard disk.

If You Have OS/2 Dual Boot with DOS or OS/2 Boot Manager
with DOS
--------------------------------------------------------
When Setup detects OS/2, it displays a "Non-MS-DOS Partition 
Detected" or "OS/2 Files Detected" screen. If Setup 
displayed the "Non-MS-DOS Partition Detected" screen, carry out
Procedure 1. If Setup displayed the "OS/2 Files Detected"
screen, carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1  To remove OS/2 and save the data on your 
computer:

1. When Setup displays the "Non-MS-DOS Partition Detected" 
   screen, choose the "Continue Setup" option.

2. After you set up MS-DOS 6, make sure you can access 
   your hard disk.

3. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy 
   disks or a network drive.

4. See "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in the chapter 
   "Diagnosing and Solving Problems," and carry out all the procedures 
   that appear in the following sections:

   o "Making a Startup Disk"

   o "Using Fdisk"

   o "Deleting Non-MS-DOS Partitions"

   o "Deleting Logical Drives"

   o "Deleting an Extended MS-DOS Partition"

   o "Creating a Primary MS-DOS Partition"

   o "Formatting Your Hard Disk"

5. Restart Setup. To do so, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive 
   A or drive B, and then type the following at the command 
   prompt:

   A:SETUP

   or

   B:SETUP

6. After you configure your hard disk, copy the files you 
   saved in step 3 back to the disk.

Procedure 2  To remove OS/2 and save the data on your 
computer:

NOTE If you have a version of OS/2 other than version 2.0, 
the names of the OS/2 files and directories on your 
hard disk may differ from those that appear in this 
procedure.

CAUTION Do not remove MS-DOS program files from your computer. 

1.  Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy 
    disks or a network drive.

2.  If your Setup disks are compatible with drive A, insert
    Setup Disk 1 in drive A, and then restart your computer by
    pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. After Setup displays the first
    screen, press F3 twice to quit Setup.

    If your Setup disks are not compatible with drive A,
    create a startup disk for drive A. To do so, insert 
    Setup Disk 1 in drive B, and then type the following 
    at the command prompt: 
   
    B:SETUP /F

    When prompted, choose to install MS-DOS on the floppy disk
    in drive A. After Setup is finished, leave the startup disk 
    in drive A, and then restart your computer by pressing 
    CTRL+ALT+DEL.
 
3.  Make drive C current by typing the following at the command 
    prompt:

    C:

4.  One by one, make each of the OS/2 directories and 
    subdirectories current by using the CD command, and 
    then delete all the files in them by using the DEL 
    command. For example, to make the SYSTEM subdirectory in
    the OS2 directory current and delete all the files in it, 
    type the following at the command prompt:
   
    CD \OS2\SYSTEM
    DEL *.*

5.  After you have deleted all files in these subdirectories, 
    delete the subdirectories by using the RD command. For 
    example, to delete the SYSTEM subdirectory in the OS2 
    directory on drive C, type:

    RD C:\OS2\SYSTEM

6.  After you have deleted all subdirectories in the OS2, 
    PSFONTS, SPOOL, NOWHERE, and OS!2_2.0_D directories, 
    delete all files in these directories by using the DEL 
    command.

7.  Delete the OS2, PSFONTS, SPOOL, NOWHERE, and OS!2_2.0_D 
    directories by using the RD command.

8.  Move to another disk or directory all the OS/2 files in 
    your root directory except the following:

    EA DATA.SF
    OS2lDR.MSG
    OS2lDR
    OS2KRNl
    OS2BOOT
    WP DATA. SF

9.  Change to the root directory by typing the following at the
    command prompt:
    
    CD\

10. Change the attributes of the five files listed 
    in step 8 by typing the following at the command
    prompt:

    A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\E*.*
    A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\O*.*
    A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\W*.*

11. Delete the files whose attributes you changed by typing 
    the following at the command prompt:

    DEL E*.*
    DEL O*.*
    DEL W*.*

12. Return to the root directory the files that you moved in 
    step 8.

13. Remove disks from all floppy disk drives, and then restart 
    your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

14. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B.

15. Run Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

    A:SETUP

    or

    B:SETUP

If You Have OS/2 Boot Manager Without DOS
