It also flags the line of code where there appears to be an error, which is the creation of the second \'PathIterator\'. Here, \'p1\' is used instead of \'p2\', thus causing the function to compare \'p1\' with itself. The error message and the unit test case further confirms the bug as the test is failing when it is asserting that two unequal paths should not be evaluated as equal.'}]
