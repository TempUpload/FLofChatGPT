[{'answer1': 'The intent of the function seems to be to retrieve an object from some sort of two-dimensional structure using a row key and a column key. The function checks if the row key and column key are not null, and then if they exist in the collection of keys. If either of the keys doesn\'t exist, an exception is thrown.
