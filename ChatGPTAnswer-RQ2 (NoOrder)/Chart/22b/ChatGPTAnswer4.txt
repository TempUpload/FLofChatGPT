[{'answer1': 'The function seems to be intended to return an object given a row key and a column key. The row and column keys are expected to be found within the respective lists of row and column keys, otherwise an exception is thrown.\nThere is a potential bug in this function.

The test case is expecting getObject("R1", "C2") to return null, however it\'s throwing an UnknownKeyException. This suggests that "C2" is not being recognized as a valid key in the KeyedObjects object, even though the columnKeys list should contain "C2".\nGiven that the getObject() method does not directly interact with columnKeys, it might be that KeyedObjects2D or KeyedObjects\'s methods that add objects could have some issues.\nHowever, if we have to find a potential issue within this provided getObject() method, it could be that the key was found in columnKeys, but not in the rowData object.\nHere is the updated JSON representation:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to fetch an object using provided row and column keys from a data structure with rows and columns.
