However, it then simply delegates to the superclass\'s equals method which does not have the knowledge of how to correctly compare ShapeList objects. Instead, it should compare the specific attributes of the ShapeList objects for equality.', 'answer2': 'Here\'s the updated JSON report on the given Java code snippet.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function intends to override the \'equals\' method from the \'Object\' class to provide a way of comparing if two objects of \'ShapeList\' type are equal.

The error during serialization test indicates that the current equals method is not suitable for serialized objects, as it compares object references (which will change with serialization and deserialization) rather than the content of the objects."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe error message you provided indicates that the ShapeList\'s equals method is failing when it tries to compare an original ShapeList and a serialized and deserialized version of the same ShapeList. Even though the two objects contain the same data, the equals method is returning false because it is using the Object class\'s equals method, which only checks for reference equality. Therefore, the equals method should be modified to check for equality based on the objects\' state, not their references.'}]
