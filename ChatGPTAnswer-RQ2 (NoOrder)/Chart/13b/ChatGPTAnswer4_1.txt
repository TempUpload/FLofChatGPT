This exception is being thrown when a Range object is created at line 455 in the code snippet. This negative upper bound is most likely caused by the subtraction operations at line 455, where the width of certain blocks is subtracted from the total constraint width.\nThe updated analysis, in JSON format, is as follows:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function aims to arrange various \'blocks\' within a certain rectangular area (container) according to the constraints provided.
