This could be due to a variety of factors such as timezone discrepancies, the way \'applyRules\' function is implemented, or a locale-specific handling of week numbers. This doesn\'t necessarily indicate a bug in the function \'format\', but rather it suggests that the underlying rules or configurations might need to be reviewed and adjusted.'}]
