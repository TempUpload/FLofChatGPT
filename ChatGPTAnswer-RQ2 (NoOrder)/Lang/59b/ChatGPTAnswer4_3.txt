[{'answer1': 'The following code seems to be a method from the StrBuilder class of Apache Commons Lang library.

This could be done by replacing str.getChars(0, strLen, buffer, size); with str.getChars(0, Math.min(strLen, width), buffer, size); on line 884 and 887. Also, the size increment should be adjusted based on the actual size of the inserted string or padding.'}]
