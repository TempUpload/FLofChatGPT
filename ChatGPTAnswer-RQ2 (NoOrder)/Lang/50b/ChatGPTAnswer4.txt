The failure in the test case \'test_changeDefault_Locale_DateTimeInstance\' where the expected locale is \'de_DE\' (Germany) but was \'en_US\' (United States) further strengthens the identification of the locale handling issue in the method \'getDateTimeInstance\'. The expected behaviour would be to return a \'FastDateFormat\' with the default locale if none is provided, however due to the issue in the original code, the locale is not properly updated in the cache key leading to this discrepancy.'}]
