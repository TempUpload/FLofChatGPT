However, the error message does not specify what the input was or what assertion failed. Thus, it\'s not clear which specific part of the function isNumber(String) is behaving unexpectedly.\nHowever, analyzing the provided function and the mentioned test cases, there are some potential bugs in the function, as I detailed in my previous analysis.
