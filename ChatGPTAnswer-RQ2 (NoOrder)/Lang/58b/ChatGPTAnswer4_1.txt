Looking at the code provided, this seems to be happening because the string does not satisfy the condition on line 455 (isDigits(numeric.substring(1))), causing the function to reach the default case of the switch statement (line 495), where it throws an exception.\nAfter analyzing the provided code and the error message, there are some issues that could be problematic.
