The analysis has been updated to reflect this potential issue. Still, it\'s essential to note that without further contextual understanding or the ability to debug and run tests on the function, these fault localizations are based on the provided error message and the code itself. Actual debugging will be necessary to confirm and fix the exact root cause.'}]
