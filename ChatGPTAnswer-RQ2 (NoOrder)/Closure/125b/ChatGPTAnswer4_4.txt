The actual code context and behavior might be different, which may cause different potential bugs or none at all.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the test case, it appears that the issue is related to the type handling logic within the visitNew method. Let\'s dig in.\nThe exception is a java.lang.IllegalStateException which is thrown at the line com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitNew(TypeCheck.java:1663). Based on your original snippet, this corresponds to the line ensureTyped(t, n, fnType.getInstanceType());.\nConsidering the details in the error message and the logic of the visitNew function, the potential issue is that fnType.getInstanceType() is likely being called on a FunctionType that is not a constructor, thus causing the exception.\nLet\'s update the JSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'visitNew\' is designed to visit and handle a new node in a tree structure.
