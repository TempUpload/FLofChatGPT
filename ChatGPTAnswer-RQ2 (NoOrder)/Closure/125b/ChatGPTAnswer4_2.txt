Proper null checks should be employed to ensure the robustness of the code.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the test case, we can deduce that the java.lang.IllegalStateException at FunctionType.getInstanceType(FunctionType.java:1071) occurred when executing the testIssue1002 unit test. It seems that the issue is related to a mismatch between the actual and expected type of an object.\nNow, let\'s focus on the error trace:\nThe error starts with FunctionType.getInstanceType(), and the traceback shows it\'s called from the function TypeCheck.visitNew(TypeCheck.java:1663) - specifically the line ensureTyped(t, n, fnType.getInstanceType()); from our original code snippet.\nGiven this, let\'s re-analyze our code snippet with the new information.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function seems intended to handle the visiting of \'new\' nodes in a JavaScript AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

The code doesn\'t seem to anticipate cases where fnType might represent an interface (or any other non-constructor type) and incorrectly calls getInstanceType() on it.'}]
