The issues mentioned might not be actual bugs if certain preconditions are met in the rest of the codebase.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, the problematic line that throws the java.lang.IllegalStateException is inside the getInstanceType method of the FunctionType class. The line from the provided code snippet that triggered this error is in TypeCheck.visitNew at line 1663.\nUsing this information and analyzing the given code snippet, the updated JSON is as follows:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'visitNew\' processes a new instance creation in a JavaScript-like AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
