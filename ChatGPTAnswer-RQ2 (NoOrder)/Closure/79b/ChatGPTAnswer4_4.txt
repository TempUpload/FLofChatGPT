Given the error message, I\'ll analyze the code snippet from the first prompt again and update the JSON object to reflect new insights.\nThe error seems to be related to an internal compiler error involving duplicate variable declarations, specifically within the removeDuplicateDeclarations method.

The snippet itself does not seem to contain the logic causing the error; it\'s likely within the method removeDuplicateDeclarations or the classes being used. Therefore, a complete analysis might require access to the full codebase.'}]
