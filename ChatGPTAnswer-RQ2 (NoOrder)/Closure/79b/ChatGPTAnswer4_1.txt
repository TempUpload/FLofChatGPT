The error seems to be related to variable redeclaration (the method named onRedeclaration was invoked) and the test case shows a duplicate variable declaration ("var a,b,c; var a,b").\nUsing this context, we can refine our analysis of the original code:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function aims to process the given nodes \'externs\' and \'root\'.

This method is likely the source of the error when trying to handle duplicate variable declarations."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 119,\n      "codeContent": "public void process(Node externs, Node root) {",\n      "reason": "It\'s unclear if \'Node\', \'NodeTraversal\', and other classes or methods are imported and available in this context.

This method might not be handling re-declarations properly, causing the internal compiler error observed. However, the actual error might be within the removeDuplicateDeclarations method\'s implementation or related methods.'}]
