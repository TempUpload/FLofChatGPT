Given the code snippet you\'ve provided earlier, there is indeed an issue with handling return nodes within computeFollowNode that might be causing this error.\nWith this new context, let\'s re-analyze the initial code snippet and produce an updated JSON representation.\nIntent of this function:\nThis function (computeFollowNode) determines the control flow of a program.

For instance, if the node isn\'t coming out of the TRY, CATCH, or FINALLY blocks, there\'s no return value specified.\nThere are calls to computeFallThrough without its implementation provided. This method\'s behavior could be a potential source of issues.\nThere\'s potential misbehavior with the nextSibling loop.
