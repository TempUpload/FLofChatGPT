In a real-world scenario, you\'d ideally have more context to determine if the identified potential issues are genuine bugs or if they are handled elsewhere in the codebase.', 'answer2': 'Given the additional context of the error message and the unit test case, we can refine our understanding and analysis of the initial code snippet.\nThe error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual type inferred by the caseObjectType function.
