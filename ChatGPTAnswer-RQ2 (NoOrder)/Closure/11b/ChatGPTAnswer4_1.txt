Without more context or the ability to run tests, it\'s challenging to definitively identify bugs, but the noted areas are worth a careful review.', 'answer2': 'Certainly! Based on the provided error message and the unit test case, it seems the test is expecting a warning when trying to access a property on a null value, but the warning isn\'t being generated.
