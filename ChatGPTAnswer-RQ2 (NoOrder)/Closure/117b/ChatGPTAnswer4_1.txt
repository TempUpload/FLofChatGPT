Specifically, if the node isn\'t of the \'GETPROP\' type or if the \'objectType\' couldn\'t be determined, the function could continue executing past intended logic.\nThe comment suggests not displaying complex function names, but the actual code seems to only differentiate between function types and other types.\nThere\'s an assumption made that every property will eventually be found in the prototype chain. There should be some handling or reporting in case it isn\'t.\nThe default behavior for an unknown node type is to return its toString representation. This might not be the intended behavior in all cases and can be a potential area for bugs or unwanted outcomes.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and the unit test case, the code seems to be failing when trying to identify the original type where a property (prop in this case) was defined, especially when that property might not exist on the given type (C2).\nHere\'s an updated JSON response reflecting a detailed analysis of the code snippet from the first prompt:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'getReadableJSTypeName\' aims to retrieve a human-readable type name for a given JavaScript Node \'n\'.

The code snippet provided has logic to climb the prototype chain, but it doesn\'t seem to have a safeguard or handler for when the desired property is not found in any of the prototypes. This lack of handling can lead to the observed error.'}]
