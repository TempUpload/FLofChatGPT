Some of the potential issues might be addressed elsewhere in the actual program. It would be ideal to have access to the entire codebase and the related API to provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment.', 'answer2': 'Certainly, with the new information provided, let\'s analyze the code snippet from the first prompt again.\nGiven that the error indicates an issue with retrieving the property prop on a C2 object, it suggests that the getReadableJSTypeName function might not correctly retrieve the prototype chain for object properties.

The error might be related to how the getReadableJSTypeName function identifies and traverses the prototype chain, which can lead to the reported discrepancy in the unit test\'s expected and actual outcomes.'}]
