The other issues are based on the provided code snippet, and it is recommended to review the rest of the codebase to make sure all referenced functions are defined and the intended logic is properly implemented.', 'answer2': 'Certainly! By analyzing the provided code snippet along with the error message and unit test case, it is clear that the unit test is failing on the line assertFalse(testLocalValue("new x()"));.
