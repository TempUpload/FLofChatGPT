Let\'s analyze the provided code snippet to understand its intent and identify any potential bugs.\nIntent of the Function\nThe function maybeRestrictTwoNames is likely intended to refine the types of two variables (names) within a given flow scope, if possible. It accepts a flow scope object, two nodes (left and right) representing the names to be refined, two boolean flags (leftIsRefineable and rightIsRefineable) to determine whether the names can be refined, and two restricted types for each name. If a name is refineable and its restricted type is not null, it will be declared in a new child flow scope using the declareNameInScope method. If either or both names are refined, the new child flow scope is returned; otherwise, the original blind scope is returned.\nFault Localization\nBased on the given code snippet, no apparent syntax errors or logical bugs are present.
