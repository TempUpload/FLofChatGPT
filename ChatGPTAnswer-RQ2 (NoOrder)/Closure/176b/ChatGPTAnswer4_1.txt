After analyzing the given error message and unit test case alongside the original code snippet, it appears that the error message does not provide direct information related to the exact location of the problem in the code snippet. However, the error is related to type checking, and we can refine our analysis by focusing on potential type-related issues.\nHere\'s the updated JSON-formatted analysis of the code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'updateScopeForTypeChange\' appears to update the scope for a particular type change within the code flow, taking into consideration specific tokens like NAME and GETPROP.

Without more details or access to surrounding code, it\'s difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the junit error within this snippet.'}]
