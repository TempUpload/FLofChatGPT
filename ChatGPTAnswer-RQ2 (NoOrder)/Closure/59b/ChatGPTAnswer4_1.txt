The error message suggests that there is a discrepancy between the expected warning level and the actual warning level. The testCheckGlobalThisOff is indicating that despite turning off the globalThis warning, it\'s still being triggered. The issue likely resides around the handling of options.checkGlobalThisLevel, which is addressed in the second entry of the \'faultLocalization\' list.'}]
