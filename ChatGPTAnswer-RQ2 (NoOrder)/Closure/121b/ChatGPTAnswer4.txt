This means that even though x is assigned the value of u before the function call, it can\'t be guaranteed that the value remains unchanged after the call. Thus, inlining the variable x might lead to incorrect results. The fault localization attempts to pinpoint potential areas in the code snippet where this issue might arise.'}]
