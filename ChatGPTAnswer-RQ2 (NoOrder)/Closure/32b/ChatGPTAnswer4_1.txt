[{'answer1': 'Analysis:\nintentOfThisFunction: The function aims to extract multi-line text from a given input stream, handling different tokens representing elements like end-of-comment, end-of-line, end-of-file, etc. If a token indicates the end of a comment or the end of a file, or if the token is an annotation (with certain whitespace options), the function captures the processed text, marks the section in the \'jsdocBuilder\' and returns an ExtractionInfo object with the extracted text and token.\nfaultLocalization:\nHere are some suspicious or potentially problematic parts of the function:\nlineNumber: 1363\ncodeContent: // Mark the position after the star as the new start of the line.\nreason: The comment suggests an action (marking the position after the star), but no action is performed in this branch of the switch-case.
