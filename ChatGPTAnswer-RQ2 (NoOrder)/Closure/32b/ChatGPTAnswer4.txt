It\'s essential to evaluate these locations within the larger context of the entire codebase and test cases to validate and rectify the concerns raised.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message, it seems that the extractMultilineTextualBlock function does not preserve leading and trailing whitespace as expected. The error message implies that there\'s an extra space in the resulting string. Specifically, the difference is between "< Foo\\n[Bar\\n\\n]Baz>" and "< Foo\\n[ Bar\\n\\n]Baz>". Here\'s an updated analysis based on this insight:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to extract multiline textual blocks from JSDoc comments.

The exact nature of the bug might be clearer when looking at other parts of the code, especially how stream.getRemainingJSDocLine() and trimEnd(line) are defined and behave.'}]
