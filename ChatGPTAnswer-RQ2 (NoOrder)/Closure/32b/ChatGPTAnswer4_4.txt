It is advisable to cross-verify the listed potential issues with the broader context of the application and intended functionality.', 'answer2': 'Based on the error message and the test case, the issue seems to be related to whitespace handling. The error message suggests that there\'s an unexpected space after the newline in the parsed output. This implies that the extractMultilineTextualBlock function might be incorrectly preserving or adding whitespaces.\nHere\'s the updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to extract multiline textual content from a stream of JsDoc tokens.

The test case has shown that under certain conditions, an unwanted space gets appended. The developer should closely review the logic around these lines and consider the various scenarios in which whitespace should be added or preserved.'}]
