The code seems to have missed this in some situations.\nLet\'s update the JSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function intends to format a JSError object into a readable string format.

The function does not add an arrow when \'charno\' is equal to the length of \'sourceExcerpt\', which is contrary to the intent described in the comment on line 96.'}]
