Always evaluate any changes in the context of the entire system.', 'answer2': 'Given the updated information and looking back at the first code snippet, we can consider the error message to refine our analysis. The error message indicates an INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR during compilation, and the unit test case testIncompleteFunction seems to revolve around the scenario of an incomplete function declaration.\nWith this new context, let\'s reanalyze the first code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `traverseFunction` is designed to traverse a \'function\' node of an abstract syntax tree.

Potential pitfalls include assumptions about the structure of the function node and its children.'}]
