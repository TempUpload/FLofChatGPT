However, the last line will reject it as not being a simple number because it checks if the first character is \'0\'. If the intended behavior is to consider \'0\' as a simple number, this is an issue. If the intent is to exclude \'0\', then the function is behaving as expected.', 'answer2': 'The error you\'ve provided indicates that there is a discrepancy in the way some JavaScript code is being printed out in the context of the com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942 unit test.\nThe expected output for the code "var x = {0: 1};" is "var x={0:1}".

If isSimpleNumber indeed affects how the JavaScript code is printed, it might misinterpret the string "0" as not a simple number, thus leading to the printing issue.'}]
