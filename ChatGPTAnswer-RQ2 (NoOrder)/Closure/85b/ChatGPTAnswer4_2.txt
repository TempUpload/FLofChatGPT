Always consider the whole context when addressing potential bugs.', 'answer2': 'Upon considering the error message in conjunction with the given code snippet, the intention of the function becomes clearer. The function aims to remove unnecessary branching, specifically around switch-case constructs.\nGiven the error message, there seems to be an issue with handling the removal of break statements in switch-case constructs.
