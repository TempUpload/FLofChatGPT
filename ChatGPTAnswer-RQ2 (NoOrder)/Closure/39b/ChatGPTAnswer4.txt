The intent of the function is deduced from its structure and naming, but some details might be missed without the broader context. Similarly, the \'faultLocalization\' section points out potential issues or areas of concern in the code, but whether they\'re actual bugs or just areas to review depends on the larger application and its requirements.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and the unit test case, the problem seems to lie in how recursive records are represented when the toStringHelper function is called.

This likely results from the logic around line 378 not accounting for recursive structures.'}]
