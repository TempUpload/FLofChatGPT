This is likely because a specific error (related to GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL) was expected but was not produced.\nRevisiting the original code snippet with this context, let\'s analyze:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to identify aliases within a given scope.

There might be a logical flaw in how the function determines when to report this error.'}]
