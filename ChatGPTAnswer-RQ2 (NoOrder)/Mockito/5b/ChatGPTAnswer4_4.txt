[{'answer1': 'The code appears to be a method for verifying some data using a delegate object. The timer object controls how long the method will keep trying to verify the data. If returnOnSuccess is true, the method will return immediately after a successful verification. If an error occurs during verification, the method will try to handle it and continue until the timer stops.
