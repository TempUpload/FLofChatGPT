[{'answer1': 'Based on the provided code snippet, the function noMoreInteractionsWanted seems to aim at halting further interactions for a given scenario when it\'s not desired anymore. The function does this by printing the scenario and throwing a NoInteractionsWanted exception with a formatted message.
