[{'answer1': 'The intended purpose of the function \'noMoreInteractionsWanted\' seems to be to check if there are any undesired invocations in a given list of invocations and throw an error message that includes information about the undesired interaction and its location if found.\nBased on the provided code, here are potential issues that might cause bugs:\nThe function \'join\' is called but it is not clear from the provided code snippet where it is defined or what it does. This could cause a compilation error.\nThe function is attempting to create a new instance of \'LocationImpl\' but we don\'t have any details about it.

If this method doesn\'t exist on the \'Invocation\' class, this would cause a compilation error.\nSimilarly, the method \'getLocation\' is called on \'undesired\'. If this method doesn\'t exist on the \'Invocation\' class, this would cause a compilation error.\nThe function throws a \'NoInteractionsWanted\' exception, but we don\'t have any information about the constructor of this exception class.
