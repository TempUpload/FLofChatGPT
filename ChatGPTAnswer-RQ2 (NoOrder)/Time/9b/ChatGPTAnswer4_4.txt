According to the test case, it seems that this is a valid scenario that the function should be able to handle.\nThe next two issues are both related to handling negative hour offsets. If the offset in hours is negative, the function seems to behave incorrectly, as indicated by the test case. The exact reason for the failure depends on the specific implementation of FieldUtils.safeAdd() and FieldUtils.safeMultiply(), but it seems likely that the subtraction of minutesOffset when hoursInMinutes is negative could be causing the issue.'}]
