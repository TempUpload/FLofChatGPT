The error occurs at "_Creek", which suggests that the parsing stopped at a shorter id, likely "America/Dawson". This indicates that the list of timezone ids (ALL_IDS) may contain shorter ids that can match the start of a longer id, leading to incorrect parsing.\nHere\'s the updated analysis in the requested format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'parseInto\' attempts to parse a string representation of a DateTime from a given position.
