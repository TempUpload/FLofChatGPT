[{'answer1': 'Based on the provided code snippet, which seems to be written in Java and deals with date and time operations, here\'s the JSON formatted analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to compute the difference between two \'ReadablePartial\' objects (which could be any partial date and time representation, like a LocalDate, LocalTime, etc.) using a specified \'ReadablePeriod\' object.

This occurs because the function is not considering the leap years, which allows for a day 29 in February. In non-leap years, the maximum value allowed for the day in February is 28, and the function is trying to set it to 29, thus causing an exception.
