The test case suggests that an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown when the method is called with a null \'fieldType\', which seems to be handled correctly in the original code. As such, the AssertionError thrown in the test case may not be due to a bug in this method but possibly due to an issue with the test case itself or the state of the \'Partial\' object at the time the method is called.'}]
