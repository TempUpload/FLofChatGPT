The iterative approach expands from the initial value until it locates an interval with function values at the ends having opposite signs. Potential issues are identified, such as potential exceptions when evaluating the function and the conditions used for bracketing.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the provided unit test case, the problem is clearer. The test case attempts to find an inverse cumulative probability value for a normal distribution. The provided code snippet handles the bracketing logic to locate a root (zero value) of a function within a specified interval. The failure in the test case is related to this bracketing logic, indicating that the code snippet is unable to properly locate the root within the specified interval.\nLet\'s refine the faultLocalization based on this new information:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function aims to bracket a root (i.e., locate an interval [a,b] where a root of the given function exists) of a univariate function within a given interval [lowerBound, upperBound].

Adjusting the bracketing logic, such as using a dynamic step size or refining the loop continuation conditions, might help address this issue.'}]
