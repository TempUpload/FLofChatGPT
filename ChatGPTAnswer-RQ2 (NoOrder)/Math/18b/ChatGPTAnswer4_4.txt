If boundaries is null, the function simply returns the input array. Otherwise, it calculates the result by subtracting the element of the input array x with the lower boundary and then divides it by the difference between the upper and lower boundaries.\nNow, let\'s perform fault localization:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to normalize the input array \'x\' based on predefined boundaries.
