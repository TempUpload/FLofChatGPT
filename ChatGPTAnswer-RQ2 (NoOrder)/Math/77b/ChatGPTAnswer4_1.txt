The function seems to be trying to compute this norm for the array named data.\nThe suspicious code is on line 721. The purpose of this line seems to be to update the max variable to the greater of its current value and the absolute value of a. However, the += operator adds the result of Math.max(max, Math.abs(a)) to the current value of max, which will not yield the desired L-infinity norm.
