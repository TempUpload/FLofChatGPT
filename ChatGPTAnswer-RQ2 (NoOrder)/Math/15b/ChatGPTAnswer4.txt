It\'s important to verify these dependencies in the broader codebase to ensure correct functionality.', 'answer2': 'Based on the given code snippet and the error message provided by the unit test case, it appears that the code snippet is an implementation of the pow function, which calculates the power of x raised to y (x^y).
