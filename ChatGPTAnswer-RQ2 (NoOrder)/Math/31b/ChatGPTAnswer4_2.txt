However, to fully understand the accuracy and correctness of the function, a more in-depth analysis might be necessary, including understanding the exact mathematical formula being approximated and how the approximation method works.', 'answer2': 'Let\'s revisit the code snippet and the error message. The error message indicates that during the evaluation of the continued fraction, the function diverged to NaN for value 0.5.
