(7.796578226186635 < 10.99), it appears that there is an issue related to the time values being used in the function. The error message suggests that there\'s a situation where a time is unexpectedly less than a prior time.\nUsing this information, let\'s further analyze the code snippet from the first prompt:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function accepts a step in a numerical integration-like procedure while considering possible events that might occur during the step.
