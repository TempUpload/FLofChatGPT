If this is a typo, it may lead to unexpected behavior. If this is not a typo, and the variable is indeed declared elsewhere in the code with the given case, then the code snippet might not contain any bugs, but the presented inconsistency may still lead to confusion.', 'answer2': 'Certainly!

Without more context on the methods and classes used (such as interpolator), it is challenging to precisely locate the root cause of this error. However, the lines identified may be a starting point for deeper investigation.'}]
