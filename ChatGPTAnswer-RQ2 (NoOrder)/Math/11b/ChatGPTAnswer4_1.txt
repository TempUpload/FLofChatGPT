The goal of the test is to check if the density calculation is consistent between a 1D multivariate normal distribution and a univariate normal distribution.\nWe\'ll now look at the code snippet provided in the first prompt to localize the possible fault.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function calculates the density of a given data point \'vals\' based on some model parameters.
