The given unit test case compares the density calculated by MultivariateNormalDistribution with a univariate NormalDistribution, expecting them to be equal. This points towards an expectation that the density method should implement a univariate normal distribution when the dimension is one.\nThe error in the test case hints that the function is returning a value far from what is expected for a univariate distribution.
