It appears that tree.getAttribute() returns an object of type BoundaryAttribute, which cannot be directly cast to Boolean. This type mismatch is the root cause of the ClassCastException. A solution might involve checking the type of the attribute and extracting the boolean information in a safe manner.'}]
