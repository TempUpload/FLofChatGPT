The source of this error seems to come from the parameters provided by ParameterGuesser, which are used by the Gaussian fitting procedure.\nLet\'s analyze the code snippet provided initially with this new context:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function appears to fit a set of observations to a Gaussian distribution, making an initial guess for the parameters of the distribution before performing the fitting.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 120,\n      "codeContent": "final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();",\n      "reason": "This line generates the initial parameter guesses for the Gaussian fit.

The focus here is on the initial guesses from ParameterGuesser, which may not be valid for the Gaussian fitting method.'}]
