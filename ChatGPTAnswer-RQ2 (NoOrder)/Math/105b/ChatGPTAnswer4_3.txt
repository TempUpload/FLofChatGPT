If sumXX happens to be zero, the function would throw a runtime exception (ArithmeticException in Java). Therefore, it would be prudent to handle this scenario.', 'answer2': 'Given the provided error message and unit test case, the test seems to be checking that the value returned from getSumSquaredErrors() is always non-negative.
