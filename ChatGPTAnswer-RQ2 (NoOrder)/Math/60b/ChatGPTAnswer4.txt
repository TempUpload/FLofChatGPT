Potential issues include the unchecked division by the \'standardDeviation\', which might be zero, and the unclear comment about JDK 1.5.', 'answer2': 'Given the new error message and the context of the unit test case, let\'s perform an analysis on the original code snippet again.\nError context:\nThe error appears to be due to the calculation in the Erf.erf method which is eventually leading to a "Continued fraction diverged to NaN for value ¡Þ". From the unit test, it seems like this occurs when extreme values (like Double.MAX_VALUE or Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) are passed into the cumulativeProbability method.\nJSON analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to compute the cumulative probability of a given value \'x\' by making use of the error function (Erf.erf).
