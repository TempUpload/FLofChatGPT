The expectation was that the constructor would throw a NotStrictlyPositiveException when given a negative mean, but instead, it threw a MathRuntimeException with the message the Poisson mean must be positive.\nGiven the error message and the intent of the test, I\'ll provide an updated JSON analysis for the provided code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The given function is a constructor for the PoissonDistributionImpl class.
