Both of these issues are related to the nature of the Poisson Distribution and the appropriateness of certain parameters.', 'answer2': 'Given the additional context provided by the error message and the unit test case, let\'s analyze the initial code snippet again. The error message indicates a problem with negative means, which is consistent with the logic in the constructor.

While the logic itself is correct in catching this condition, the type of exception being thrown does not match what the unit test expects.\nIt might be helpful to consider updating the code to throw the expected NotStrictlyPositiveException or to modify the unit test to expect MathRuntimeException.'}]
