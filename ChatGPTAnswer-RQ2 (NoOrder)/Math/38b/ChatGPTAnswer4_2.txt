You only provided the error message and the unit test case in your current prompt.\nHowever, I can give you an analysis based on the error message and the unit test case.\nFrom the error message, we can tell:\nThere\'s an exception being thrown in the BOBYQAOptimizer class, specifically in the prelim method on line 1752. The exception itself seems to be suggesting a fix (which is unusual): "If this exception is thrown, just remove it from the code prelim."\nThe unit test case testConstrainedRosenWithMoreInterpolationPoints is testing the optimization of the Rosen function under constraints. It seems to be iterating through a range of values (1 to maxAdditionalPoints, which is set to 47) and trying to optimize the function for each of these.\nThe comment in the unit test:\narduino\nCopy code\n// This should have been 78 because in the code the hard limit is\n// said to be\n//   ((DIM + 1) * (DIM + 2)) / 2 - (2 * DIM + 1)\n// i.e. 78 in this case, but the test fails for 48, 59, 62, 63, 64,\n// 65, 66, ...\n... suggests that the code has a defined hard limit, but it seems to be failing for certain values below that limit.\nGiven the provided information, here\'s an updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The unit test function seems to be testing the optimization of the Rosen function under constraints.
