Based on the code snippet you provided initially and the error message indicating that the test case expected 0.0 but received Infinity, it appears that there is a specific handling issue for large positive numbers.\nHere\'s the updated JSON object that focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, and identifies the area that might be causing the error:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function calculates the hyperbolic cosine (cosh) of a given input x, considering special handling for values where x > 20 or x < -20 to avoid overflow.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 394,\n      "codeContent": "if (x > 20) { return 0.5 * exp(x); }",\n      "reason": "The condition for handling large positive values is likely incorrect.
