This test seems designed to ensure that the Mann每Whitney U test identifies these two distinct datasets appropriately. The error from the test case suggests that the calculated P-value might be closer to 0, which would indicate a strong difference between the two datasets, but the test expects it to be greater than 0.1.\nGiven this, it\'s important to further validate the original function, especially the mathematical computations, against the theoretical expectations of the Mann每Whitney U test.'}]
