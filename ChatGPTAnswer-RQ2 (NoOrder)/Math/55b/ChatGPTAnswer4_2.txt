The function\'s comments talk about precision handling and preconditioning, but the code doesn\'t implement those steps, making it a potential fault in the function.', 'answer2': 'Considering the given error and the test case, it appears that the crossProduct function is not handling the scenario described in its comments. The test case provides two vectors with large magnitudes, and the comments in the original function discuss reducing cancellation errors by preconditioning.\nGiven this information, let\'s update our JSON object based on the original code snippet and the provided error:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function intends to compute the cross product of two 3D vectors v1 and v2.
