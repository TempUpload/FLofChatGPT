It\'s advisable to sanitize or escape the input toolTipText to prevent such vulnerabilities.', 'answer2': 'From the error message, it\'s evident that the method generateToolTipFragment in the StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator class does not escape special characters properly. Specifically, the error shows that the string Series "A", 100.0 should be converted to Series &quot;A&quot;, 100.0 in the HTML title attribute, but the method is not doing so.\nHere\'s a JSON representation of the updated analysis considering the new error message:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function aims to generate tooltips using the HTML title attribute for image map area tags.

As the error suggests, characters like \'\\"\' should be escaped as \'&quot;\' in the resulting HTML.

One can use libraries like Apache Commons StringEscapeUtils or manually create a function that escapes the necessary characters for HTML.'}]
