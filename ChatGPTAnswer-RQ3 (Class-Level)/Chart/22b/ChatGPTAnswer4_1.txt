It aims to:\nValidate that added objects can be retrieved using their corresponding row and column keys.\nEnsure that null is returned when an object doesn\'t exist for the provided keys.\nConfirm that the UnknownKeyException is thrown when trying to retrieve an object with an unrecognized row or column key.\nFor the faultLocalization:\nThe key issue seems to be associated with how the KeyedObjects2D data structure handles non-existing keys. Based on the provided error message and the test case, here are the potential faults:\nLine 211: The code tries to get an object using the key "R1" for the row and "C2" for the column. However, this combination wasn\'t added to the KeyedObjects2D data structure.
