It is meant to verify another VerificationMode (referred to as the delegate) within a certain timeframe. It polls the delegate\'s verification within the specified polling period and duration. If the delegate is satisfied within this timeframe, behavior depends on the returnOnSuccess parameter: if true, the verification mode is immediately satisfied; if false, it waits until the full duration has passed.",\n\n    "faultLocalization": [\n        {\n            "lineNumber": 89,\n            "codeContent": "error = handleVerifyException(e);",\n            "reason": "There\'s potential code duplication here.
