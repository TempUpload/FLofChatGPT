I\'ll analyze the error message in conjunction with the code to provide a more precise fault localization.\nHere\'s the JSON object updated based on this new analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The ReturnsDeepStubs function aims to provide a deep stub implementation for Mockito, allowing users to chain mock method calls.
