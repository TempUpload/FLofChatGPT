This could result in incorrect behavior.\nThe hashCode method returning a constant value can cause issues when used in data structures like HashSet or HashMap. Normally, when two objects are considered equal according to their equals method, their hash codes must also be the same. In this case, since hashCode always returns 1, it can lead to inefficient hash map behaviors.'}]
