The class is intended to be immutable and thread-safe. It caches instances of unsupported duration fields and provides several methods to get the type, name, and other properties of the field. Most of the methods throw UnsupportedOperationException since the field is not supported.\nFault Localization:\nAfter analyzing the code snippet, the given error message, and the unit test case, here is the JSON object that captures potential suspicious locations in the code:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "A placeholder implementation for duration fields that are not supported in the Joda-Time library.
