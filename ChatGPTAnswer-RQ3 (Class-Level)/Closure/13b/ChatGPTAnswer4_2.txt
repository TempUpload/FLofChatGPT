If any_expression evaluates to true, it assigns the reference of external_ref to fn2 and then assigns an anonymous function to fn1 that invokes fn2 when called. This function returns an object with two methods, method1 and method2. The method1 invokes fn1 if it\'s defined and always returns true.

The remaining suspicions are based on the control flow structures and assignments that could be affected by the optimization process.'}]
