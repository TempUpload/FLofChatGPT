Here\'s the updated analysis of the given code snippet in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This code provides an implementation of the `JsAst` class that represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a JavaScript source file.

So, the actual cause of the error might lie outside of the provided code snippet, possibly in how the parsed AST is then processed or transformed by other parts of the system.'}]
