Proper testing and extensive review would be necessary to catch all potential issues, especially for mathematical algorithms.', 'answer2': 'Certainly, let\'s tackle this step by step.\nAnalysis of Problem:\nFrom the error message, it appears that the TooManyEvaluationsException exception is being thrown when the number of evaluations exceeds the limit set by the developer, which in this case is 100. Specifically, the exception is thrown when the method incrementEvaluationCount is called, but it\'s from the method solve of BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver that the error has originated.\nGiven Unit Test:\nThe test case titled testIssue716 is setting up a solver with some precision parameters and then trying to solve a univariate function named sharpTurn. The function is expected to return a root within the range of -0.9999999 to 30 using a starting point of 15. The expected root is -0.5 and the function value at that root should be very close to 0.\nAnalysis of the Function:\nGiven that you\'ve only provided the error message and unit test for the function and haven\'t provided the actual function from the first prompt, I\'ll be unable to directly analyze the function code for bugs.
