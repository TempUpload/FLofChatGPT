This decomposition method decomposes a symmetric, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which in real-valued matrices is the regular transpose.\nThe test:\nCreates a real matrix m1 and decomposes it with the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition method.\nIt then attempts to rebuild the original matrix by multiplying the root of the decomposition by its transpose.\nFinally, it asserts that the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt one has a norm of 0 (or very close to 0, within a tolerance).\nGiven the error message provided, it seems that the test expected the difference to be 0 (or within a tolerance of 1.0e-16), but it turned out to be 0.0180652917341963.\nWith this understanding, let\'s create the JSON:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The test function is intended to check the accuracy of the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition method.
