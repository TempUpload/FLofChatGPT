I can help you analyze the problem using the provided error message and the unit test code.\nBut, you didn\'t provide the code snippet from the "first prompt." You\'ve only provided the error message and the unit test case in this current prompt. If you can share the original code snippet, I\'d be better equipped to help you out.\nThat said, based on the error message and the unit test case, I can still provide a preliminary analysis:\nIntent of the Function:\nThe function testExtremeValues() aims to test the cumulativeProbability method of the NormalDistributionImpl class for extreme values. It ensures that for a large range of negative and positive values, the cumulative probability behaves as expected.\nFault Localization:\nBased on the given error message and unit test case, the possible fault locations are:\nLine 174: assertEquals(distribution.cumulativeProbability(Double.MAX_VALUE), 1, 0);\nReason: The error stack trace suggests a "Continued fraction diverged to NaN for value ¡Þ" error, which hints at issues with handling very large numbers. This line tests the cumulativeProbability method with the largest finite value Double.MAX_VALUE, which is a possible source of the error.\nLine 175: assertEquals(distribution.cumulativeProbability(-Double.MAX_VALUE), 0, 0);\nReason: This line tests the cumulativeProbability method with the negative of the largest finite value, which could be another potential cause of the convergence error.\nLine 176: assertEquals(distribution.cumulativeProbability(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY), 1, 0);\nReason: The error message specifically mentions divergence for the value ¡Þ.
