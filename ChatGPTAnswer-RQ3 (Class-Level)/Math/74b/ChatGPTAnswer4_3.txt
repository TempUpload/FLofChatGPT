If you could share the original code snippet with me again, I can proceed with the analysis as described.\nFor now, based on the error message and unit test case you provided:\nintentOfThisFunction:\nThe function polynomial is designed to test the performance of the AdamsMoultonIntegrator for a test problem (TestProblem6). It tries different numbers of steps (from 1 to 6) and checks if the number of evaluations required by the integrator is within a specific range.
