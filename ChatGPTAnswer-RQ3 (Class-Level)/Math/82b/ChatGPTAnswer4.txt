It\'s worth noting that some of these issues may not necessarily cause bugs in all contexts. Testing and further verification are essential to validate these observations.', 'answer2': 'Having the error message and the related unit test gives us a better context for pinpointing potential issues. Considering the nature of the error and the testMath288 unit test, the solver seems to be producing an unexpected result.
