However, I can use the error message and the unit test case you provided to help with the analysis.\nBased on the error message and the unit test case:\nThe error message originates from the inverseCumulativeProbability function in the NormalDistributionImpl class.\nThe test case (testMath280) is using the NormalDistributionImpl class to create a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It then tries to compute the inverse cumulative probability for the value 0.9772498680518209 and expects the result to be 2.0.\nFrom this:\n\'intentOfThisFunction\':\nThe intended purpose of the testMath280 function is to test the inverseCumulativeProbability method of the NormalDistributionImpl class, ensuring that for a given input probability (0.9772498680518209), the method returns a correct value close to 2.0.\n\'faultLocalization\':\nWithout having the actual code from the first prompt, I can only provide generic advice:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "To test the inverseCumulativeProbability method of the NormalDistributionImpl class, ensuring it returns a value close to 2.0 for the given input probability.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": "NormalDistributionImpl.java:162",\n      "codeContent": "Presumed content of inverseCumulativeProbability method",\n      "reason": "The error originates from this method.
