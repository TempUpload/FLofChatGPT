This means that if x equals the upper bound, the density will return 0. However, the documentation and other methods suggest that the upper bound is exclusive. Thus, the comparison should be changed.\nLine 200: The sampling method currently doesn\'t seem to achieve a truly uniform distribution over the range [lower, upper) because of how u (a uniformly random value between 0 and 1) is combined with (1 - u). To get a uniform sample over the range, the usual formula is to take the lower bound and add the range size multiplied by the random value.'}]
