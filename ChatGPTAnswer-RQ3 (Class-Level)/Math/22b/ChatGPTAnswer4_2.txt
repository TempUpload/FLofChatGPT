Since the range is inclusive for the lower bound and exclusive for the upper bound, the correct check should be x <= lower for the lower bound and x >= upper for the upper bound.\nThe sample method (line 202) seems to use an incorrect formula to generate random samples. The provided formula does not guarantee values within the [lower, upper) range. The correct formula to get a uniformly distributed sample in the [lower, upper) range is lower + u * (upper - lower) where u is a random number in the range [0,1).'}]
