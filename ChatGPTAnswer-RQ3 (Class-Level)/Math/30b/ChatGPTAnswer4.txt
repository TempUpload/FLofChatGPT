Potential issues were highlighted based on potential overflow, memory concerns, and potential ambiguity in the two-tailed test. As always, it is important to consider the context of the application and its specific requirements to determine if these are actual issues or if they are simply potential points of concern.', 'answer2': 'Given the context of the new error message and the test case provided, the MannWhitneyUTest class seems to be failing the testBigDataSet test when processing large datasets of size 1500 for both input arrays.
