The most suspicious issue is the possible duplicate declaration of the denominatorDegreesOfFreedom variable, as indicated by the comment above it.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the unit test, it appears that the problem is related to the computation of the inverse cumulative probability in the FDistributionImpl class. The error "Invalid endpoint parameters" suggests that there\'s an issue with the values being used for bracketing a root solution in the method inverseCumulativeProbability().\nLet\'s analyze the function and update the JSON response accordingly:\nIntent of the function:\nThe code defines a class FDistributionImpl which provides an implementation of the F-Distribution. Key functionalities include computing the cumulative probability (cumulativeProbability()) and its inverse (inverseCumulativeProbability()), as well as getting and setting the degrees of freedom.\nFault Localization:\nBased on the error message, there are certain areas in the code that are potentially buggy.\nLet\'s produce the JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This code defines a class named \'FDistributionImpl\' which represents the F-distribution, a continuous probability distribution.
