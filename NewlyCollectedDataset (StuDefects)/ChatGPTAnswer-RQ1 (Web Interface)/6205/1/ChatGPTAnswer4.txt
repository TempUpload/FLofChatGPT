If the first two characters are part of the octal number, this is a bug.\nLine 16 strips trailing zeros from the BigDecimal, which might be unnecessary or could remove meaningful zeros.\nLine 11 initializes res to zero but does not consider any characters from the start of the string, if they are meant to be part of the octal number.'}]
