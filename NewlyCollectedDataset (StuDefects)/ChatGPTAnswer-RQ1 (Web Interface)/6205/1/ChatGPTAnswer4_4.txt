This will lead to errors if the character isn\'t a valid digit.\nFurther, the loop skips the first two characters of the string, which might not be intended behavior.\nFinally, while working with octal numbers, only digits between 0 and 7 are valid, but there\'s no check to ensure that the input string only contains these digits.'}]
