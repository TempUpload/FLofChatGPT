This contradicts the typical Fibonacci sequence where the first two numbers are usually 0 and 1 or 1 and 1. Also, the initial values of \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\' are the same, so the first number in the sequence will be the sum of three identical numbers (3)."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 12,\n      "codeContent": "for (int i = 4; i <= n; i++) {",\n      "reason": "The loop starts at i = 4, skipping the calculation for i=1, i=2, and i=3.
