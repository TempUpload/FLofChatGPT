This function computes a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the last three terms, modulo 10,000.

Additionally, the code is not protected against potential StringIndexOutOfBoundsException errors if the result of the fib function is less than 4 digits long. Lastly, there\'s an unnecessary import of the java.util package.'}]
