Since Math.pow(2, n) returns a double, the addition of 1 may result in an imprecise answer.\nLine 10: There\'s no input validation for the integer n read from the user. The function assumes that the user will always input an integer, which may not be the case. If the user inputs something that isn\'t an integer, the nextInt() method will throw an exception.\nLine 9: The Scanner object is never closed. While not always critical in a small example like this, it\'s generally good practice to close resources like Scanner to avoid potential resource leaks.'}]
