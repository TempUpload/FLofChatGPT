While not closing System.in isn\'t detrimental, it\'s a bad pattern because in other contexts, not closing resources can cause leaks.\nLines 9, 10, 14: The code is blindly trusting that the user\'s input will be integers. This is generally a bad practice and can result in runtime exceptions.\nLine 11: Creating an array without checking the validity of its size is risky. If \'n\' or \'m\' are negative or exceedingly large, it\'ll result in an exception.'}]
