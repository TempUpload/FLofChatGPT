It does not include the number 60, while all other conditions include the numbers at both ends of their respective ranges.\nLine 16: The function doesn\'t handle negative numbers specifically; they are all placed into \'count4\'. This may or may not be intended behavior.\nLine 8: The variable \'i\' is declared far from its point of use, which may lead to readability or maintainability issues.'}]
