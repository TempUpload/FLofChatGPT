If both conditions are met, it increments the \'res\' counter. If not, it resets the \'res\' counter. It keeps track of the maximum value of the \'res\' counter in \'max\'. At the end, it prints the \'max\' value which represents the longest sequence of valid pairs.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 13,\n      "codeContent": "if (a >= 90 && a <= 140 && b >= 60 && b <= 90) {",\n      "reason": "The condition checks if \'a\' is in the range [90, 140] and \'b\' is in the range [60, 90].
