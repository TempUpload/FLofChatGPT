If no pairs satisfy the condition, the function will output -1, which may be incorrect if the expected output for no valid sequences is 0.\nLine 7: The code doesn\'t check the validity of n. If n is negative or zero, this might cause undefined behavior or incorrect results.\nLine 11 & 12: The code lacks validation for inputs a and b. It assumes they will always be integers.\nLine 14: The variable res is incremented without any upper boundary check. This might not necessarily be a "bug," but it\'s worth noting in scenarios where data ranges are a concern.'}]
