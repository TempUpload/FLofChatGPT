It\'s recommended to use generics for type safety.\nThe declared array \'strings\' seems to be redundant since it\'s not being used anywhere in the function.\nLooping based on set.size() in line 14 can potentially lead to unpredictable behavior if the set is modified during iteration. However, in this case, the set is not being modified during iteration, but using iterator.hasNext() with a while loop would be clearer.'}]
