Using Java Generics can help in type safety.\nThe strings array is declared but never used in the code. Removing unused code can make the code cleaner and easier to understand.\nWhile the for-loop in this context is safe, in general scenarios where a set might be modified during iteration, relying on set.size() as the condition for the for-loop could be problematic.'}]
