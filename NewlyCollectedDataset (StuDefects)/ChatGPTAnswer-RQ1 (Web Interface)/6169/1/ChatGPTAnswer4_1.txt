It\'s better to specify the type for type safety.\nIn line 7, the Scanner resource is not closed, which can lead to resource leaks. It is a good practice to close resources when you are done using them, often in a finally block or by using try-with-resources.\nIn line 30, sorting is done on an untyped ArrayList. If you ever add something that is not Comparable to list2, this could lead to a ClassCastException. Specifying a type can help prevent this.\nIn line 31, there\'s no check to see if list2 is empty before attempting to get the last element. If list2 is empty, this could result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.'}]
