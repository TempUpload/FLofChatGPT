[{'answer1': 'Analysis:\nThe code snippet appears to be a Java program designed to read a series of numeric values, compute the average by excluding the highest and lowest values, and then compute the maximum difference between this average and the two second-most extreme values (_max and _min).\nLet\'s analyze for potential bugs:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The program reads a series of numeric values, computes the average by excluding the highest and lowest values, and then computes the maximum difference between this average and the two second-most extreme values (_max and _min).",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 7,\n      "codeContent": "int n = sc.nextInt();",\n      "reason": "There\'s no check for the value of \'n\'.
