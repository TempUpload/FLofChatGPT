If n is less than 2, the loop will not run, leading to incorrect calculations.\nLine 7 has no input validation for n, and the program will break if n is less than 2.\nLine 32 assumes that _min and _max are properly calculated, which may not be the case if n is less than 2.\nLine 8 doesn\'t validate that the user\'s input is a double, which could crash the program.'}]
