For example, in base-16, the remainder 10 should map to \'a\', but data[10 % 10] would index data[0], which is \'a\', and will not work for remainders greater than 10.\nThe data array only contains six characters. This is enough for hex (base-16) numbers but won\'t be sufficient for numeral systems with bases greater than 16.\n& 4. The Scanner method nextInt() will throw an exception if the input isn\'t an integer. This is a runtime error and should ideally be handled.\nNo bounds checking is done for radix. It could be any integer, including numbers like 0 or 1 that are not valid bases, or numbers that exceed the size of the data array.'}]
