Instead, == should be used to check for null values.\nThe logic at lineNumber: 20 seems to have a redundant check. It should be refined to ensure accurate calculation of the distance between occurrences.\nThe code does not ensure that there are at least two commas in the input string. If there aren\'t, str[1] and str[2] will throw an exception.\nNon-exclusive condition checks might lead to multiple \'-1\' outputs for the same input.'}]
