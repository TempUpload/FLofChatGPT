If the user provides non-integer input, the program will throw an InputMismatchException."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 5,\n      "codeContent": "Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);",\n      "reason": "Scanner is not closed after usage. This can potentially lead to resource leaks."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nSummary:\nThere is no input validation on line 7. If a user provides input that is not an integer (e.g., a string or a floating-point number), the nextInt() method will throw an InputMismatchException.\nOn line 5, a Scanner object is created but it is not closed afterwards. While this may not be a significant issue for a small program like this, it is generally a good practice to close resources like Scanner to avoid potential resource leaks.'}]
