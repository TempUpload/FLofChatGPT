To perform floating-point division, at least one of the operands should be a floating-point number."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nExplanation:\nLine 12: double temp=(num/2)+1;: This line is suspicious because when num is odd and greater than 1, the intention seems to be to compute the average of two consecutive integers. However, since both num and 2 are integers, the division will result in an integer division in Java. For instance, if num is 3, instead of getting the expected value of 2.5, you will get 2.0 due to integer truncation. A potential fix could be double temp=((double)num/2)+1; to ensure floating-point division.'}]
