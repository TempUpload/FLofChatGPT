This may cause performance issues for large values of \'n\'."\n    }\n  ]\n}\nExplanation:\nLine 14: Reading \'n\' as a double may cause unexpected behavior since the logic of \'func\' depends on decrementing \'n\' and comparing it to 0 and 1. \'n\' should be an integer or similar for the recursion to make sense.\nLines 5 & 7: In Java, using \'==\' to compare Double objects is not recommended due to object identity and floating-point inaccuracies. Using .equals() or unboxing to a primitive type is a safer option.\nLine 16: Using \'==\' for floating-point comparison is risky because of potential inaccuracies. A tolerance level should be used instead.\nLine 10: The recursive function could be very inefficient for large \'n\' as it calls itself twice without memoization. Memoizing previously calculated results would improve efficiency.'}]
