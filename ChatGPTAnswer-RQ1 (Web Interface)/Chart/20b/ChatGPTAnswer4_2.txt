Depending on the actual context, additional or different errors may be found.', 'answer2': 'Given your new information, the original constructor logic seems to indeed be faulty. The error message states that the expected color was blue, but red was returned. This indicates that the incorrect Paint object is being used. We can infer from the unit test that the \'outlinePaint\' is intended to be used as a separate parameter from \'paint\'. The error is likely due to the fact that the \'outlinePaint\' parameter is not used in the super constructor call, while the \'paint\' parameter is used twice.
