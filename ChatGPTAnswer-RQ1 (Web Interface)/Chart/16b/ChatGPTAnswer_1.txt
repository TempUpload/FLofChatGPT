The unit test case also focuses on testing this method.\nLine 338: This line checks if the length of the \'categoryKeys\' array matches the length of \'startData[0]\' array. The error message and unit test case suggest that the dimensions of the arrays are not properly aligned, leading to the test failure.\nLine 345: The exception message construction seems incorrect. The message should be constructed without line numbers and unexpected characters. While this issue might not directly relate to the test failure, it\'s a good practice to ensure proper error message formatting.\nLine 344: This line checks if an individual element in \'categoryKeys\' is null. The unit test case likely covers scenarios involving null elements in the \'categoryKeys\' array.\nIt\'s worth investigating the actual values of \'categoryKeys\' and \'startData\' arrays during the execution of the unit test case to determine the root cause of the failure. The suspicion primarily falls on the array dimensions not matching, leading to the test failure.'}]
