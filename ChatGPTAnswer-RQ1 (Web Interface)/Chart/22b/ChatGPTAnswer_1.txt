If the row or column key is not found, these variables will have a value of -1, which could lead to incorrect indexing or exceptions later in the code.\nLine 231: The condition if (row >= 0) is always true because indexOf returns -1 when the key is not found. This condition should be re-evaluated or replaced to reflect the correct logic.\nLine 233: If the \'column\' value is -1 (not found), this line will throw an exception when trying to retrieve an object from the rowData object. There should be a check to handle this situation before accessing the object.\nLine 235: The else branch will never be executed due to the condition issue on line 231.
