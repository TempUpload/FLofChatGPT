The unit test case confirms the occurrence of an UnknownKeyException when trying to remove a column using a column key that is not recognized. This error message corresponds to the code at line 373, where the exception message formatting issue was identified.\nThe unit test case also includes the test for removing a known column key ("C2"), which is not functioning as expected, possibly due to issues with the removeValue method implementation (line 378).\nThe analysis prioritizes these two issues as they are directly related to the observed error and failure in the unit test case. The other identified issues also remain relevant and should be addressed to ensure the correct and reliable functioning of the removeColumn function.'}]
