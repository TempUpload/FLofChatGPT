This could lead to incorrect visibility checks for bars.\nLine 275: The condition value >= uclip should likely be value > uclip to ensure that bars with values greater than uclip are visible.\nLine 276: If the condition above is satisfied, setting value directly to uclip could lead to unintended behavior. The value should be adjusted rather than set directly.\nLine 279: Similar to line 263, the condition value <= lclip should likely be value < lclip to ensure that bars with values smaller than lclip are not visible.\nLine 280: Similar to line 276, setting value directly to lclip if the condition is satisfied could lead to unintended behavior. The value should be adjusted rather than set directly.\nThese issues are related to the incorrect handling of clipping values for the bars.
