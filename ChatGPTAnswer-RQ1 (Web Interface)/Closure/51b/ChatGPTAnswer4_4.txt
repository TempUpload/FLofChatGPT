The test case testIssue582 fails because it expects -0.0 to be outputted as -0.0, but it is being outputted as 0.\nLooking at the original code snippet, the code isn\'t handling the case of -0.0 correctly in the condition if ((long) x == x), which is checking if the number is an integer. -0.0 is considered equal to 0, and as such, is treated as an integer, which leads to incorrect string representation, specifically losing the negative sign.\nHere\'s the updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'addNumber\' is intended to convert a given double value into a string representation, implementing a form of pretty printing.
