If the associated record is empty, it returns a native object type. Otherwise, it returns a new RecordType with given properties.",\n  "faultLocalization": []\n}\nThere is no obvious faulty code in this snippet.

The \'build()\' method itself seems to be logically correct and there is no faulty code visible in the provided code snippet. The function either returns a native object type or a new RecordType based on whether the record is empty or not. The \'faultLocalization\' array is still empty as no direct faulty lines can be pointed out in this method.\nFor a complete and proper analysis, it would be necessary to inspect the context and the rest of the codebase in which the \'build()\' method is used, especially the \'registry\' and \'properties\' objects. Also, the error could be originating from how the RecordType is being utilized or manipulated in the rest of the codebase, including the unit tests.'}]
