The error is about the transformation of some JavaScript code, and the related unit test case is testing this transformation process. It does not appear to be a problem with the \'findCalledFunctions\' method or the traversal of nodes.\nWithout the rest of the code from which the \'findCalledFunctions\' method is extracted, it\'s hard to say whether or how this method contributes to the reported error.
