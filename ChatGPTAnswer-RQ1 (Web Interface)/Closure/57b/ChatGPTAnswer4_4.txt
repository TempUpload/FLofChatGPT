For instance, check if the next node is null before getting its string, and check if the node type is defined and is a string before getting its string representation.', 'answer2': 'Based on the new information, it appears that the error occurs when the function is trying to identify Google Closure require statements. Specifically, the function seems to be incorrectly extracting the class name foo when it should not.
