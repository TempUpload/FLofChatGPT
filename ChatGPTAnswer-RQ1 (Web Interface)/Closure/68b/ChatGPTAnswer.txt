However, the pattern should enclose the tag name in parentheses to form capturing groups. The correct pattern should be ^(\\\\s*@\\\\w+) to match the tag name properly.\nThe fault localization suggests that the regular expression pattern on line 2 is incorrect. It should be modified to capture the tag name correctly in JSDoc comments.\nPlease note that the analysis focused exclusively on the code snippet provided and did not consider the unit test functions.'}]
