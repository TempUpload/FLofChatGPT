It appears the function canInlineReferenceDirectly is responsible for attempting to inline functions in JavaScript code, but it seems to be generating extra variable assignments (JSCompiler_temp_const$$0 and JSCompiler_inline_result$$1), which are not present in the expected output.\nGiven the error message and the test case, it seems that the canInlineReferenceDirectly function should simply replace the call to BAR_FN with the body of BAR_FN, substituting the parameters with the actual arguments, but instead, it\'s introducing additional variables and assignments.\nHere\'s the updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'canInlineReferenceDirectly\' attempts to inline a function call directly by replacing the function call node with the body of the function.
