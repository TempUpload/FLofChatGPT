The presence or absence of dependency in the collection might not be correctly determined.\nLine 299: The def variable is checked for null, but it might not have been assigned properly before this check. This could lead to unexpected behavior.\nLine 306: The condition check might not correctly determine the assignment type. It checks whether def is an assignment node and whether its parent is not an expression assignment. There could be scenarios where this check does not accurately capture the intended conditions.\nLine 313: The checkRightOf function is called with parameters that include def, getDefCfgNode(), and SIDE_EFFECT_PREDICATE. There is a potential bug in the implementation of checkRightOf that might not handle side effects correctly.\nLine 319: The checkLeftOf function is called with parameters that include use, useCfgNode, and SIDE_EFFECT_PREDICATE. There is a potential bug in the implementation of checkLeftOf that might not handle side effects correctly.\nPlease note that this analysis is based on static code analysis and may not capture runtime or dynamic behavior.
