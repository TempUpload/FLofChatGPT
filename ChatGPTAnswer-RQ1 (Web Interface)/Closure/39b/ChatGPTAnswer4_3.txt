[{'answer1': 'Based on the given code snippet, the function toStringHelper seems to convert an object into a string format. If a reference name is available, it is returned directly. If not, the function starts by retrieving all property names of the object and its prototypes (up to the specified maximum number of properties), and then forms a string representation of these properties and their types. If the number of properties exceeds the limit, the string is truncated with a "...".\nHere is the analysis of potential bugs:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Converts an object into a string format, prioritizing the object\'s reference name if available.
