[{'answer1': 'The provided code snippet appears to be a helper function to convert an ObjectType to a String representation, either for debugging or for pretty printing. The function checks whether an ObjectType has a reference name and uses that if available. Otherwise, it will traverse the object\'s properties, putting them into a StringBuilder, and appending their names and types.
