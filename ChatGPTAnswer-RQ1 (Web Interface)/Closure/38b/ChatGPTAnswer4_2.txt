One such issue could be distinguishing between negative and positive zero, as indicated in the test case.\nHowever, the error message indicates that the function is not printing the expected format when dealing with negative zero (it is expected to print x- -0.0, but it is printing x--0.0). The problem is likely due to how the function handles negative zero values. Here\'s an updated analysis of the function:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to add a double number to a sequence of characters in a specific format, addressing possible syntax and parsing issues.
