[{'answer1': 'The code seems to be well-structured and without explicit bugs, but there are some areas which could potentially be problematic under certain conditions.

Please note that some of the potential issues might not cause any problems depending on the broader context of the code.', 'answer2': 'Based on the error message and the test case, the problem lies in how the function is handling new lines and preserving whitespace at the beginning of lines.

According to the error message from the test case, it seems that the expected behavior is to preserve the leading whitespace, but the function is currently trimming it. This could be a design flaw or a misunderstanding about the requirement.'}]
