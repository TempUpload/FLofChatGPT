[{'answer1': 'The intent of this function is to visit nodes of a given abstract syntax tree (AST) in a traversal process and perform a series of checks on these nodes, such as whether they are empty or commas, whether their parent is null, whether they have JSDoc information attached to their names, and whether their results are used or they have side effects.
