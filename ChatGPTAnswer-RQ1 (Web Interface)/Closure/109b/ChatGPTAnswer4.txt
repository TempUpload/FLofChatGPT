Additional error handling or more sophisticated parsing may be required to address this issue. Furthermore, this function lacks any form of error handling for the input parameter \'token\' and there is no null-checking which could lead to potential null pointer exceptions if \'token\' is null."\n        }\n    ]\n}\nThe specific issue seems to be within the parseTypeName function, as indicated by the error message. If the parseTypeName function is throwing this error due to an unrecognized type or syntax error, you may need to review that function\'s logic or the input it\'s receiving. The error could be due to the input not being in the expected format, or the parseTypeName function might not be correctly handling all possible valid inputs. It is recommended to validate the input \'token\' before passing it to the parseTypeName function and handle any potential exceptions that parseTypeName might throw.'}]
