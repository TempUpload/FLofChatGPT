The error message seems to come from an error in the test case for \'testIssue284\' where a variable \'goog\' was unexpected. The error is likely because \'goog\' is used without being properly defined in the context of the Compiler that runs this test case. However, this error doesn\'t have anything to do with the visitor function of a tree traversal you initially provided.\nDespite this, I will update the JSON object based on the initial code snippet and the information in the error message.
