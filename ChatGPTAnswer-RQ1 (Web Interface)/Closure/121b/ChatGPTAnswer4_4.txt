The error reveals that the function inlineNonConstants is not working correctly when dealing with cases like this. In particular, the problem seems to be in how the function handles variable inlining when the variable is used in recursive function calls.\nBased on this information, here is the updated JSON object:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function attempts to inline non-constant variables.
