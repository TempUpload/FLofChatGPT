This suggests an issue with how the code handles arrays that might not have values at certain indices. The unit test case "x = [,10][0]" attempts to assign the 0th index of an array (which doesn\'t exist in this case, as it\'s empty) to a variable, but instead of getting \'undefined\' (or \'void 0\' as it is in the unit test), it throws an "Array index out of bounds" error.
