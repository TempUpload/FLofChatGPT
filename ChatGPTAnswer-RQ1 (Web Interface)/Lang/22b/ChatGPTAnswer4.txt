However, the provided test case does not seem to have a direct relation with the method greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v).\nGiven the error message, it\'s likely that the getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator) method uses greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v) internally to reduce the fraction to its simplest form.
