It seems like the error originates from a getReducedFraction function that simplifies a fraction to its lowest terms, which was being tested in the testReducedFactory_int_int unit test. The assertion error suggests that an expected result of -1073741824 was -2147483648 instead.\nHowever, I can still provide an updated analysis of the greatestCommonDivisor function based on the new information. It seems like this function is used as part of the fraction reduction process, and an incorrect GCD value could be causing unexpected results.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'greatestCommonDivisor\' computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers \'u\' and \'v\' using the binary GCD algorithm, also known as Stein\'s algorithm.
