This hints towards an issue with how locales are managed and used within the code snippet. The issue arises when Locale.getDefault() is invoked within the getDateTimeInstance() method (lines 471-472). If the default locale has been changed after a cached instance was created, the code may return the cached format with an old locale instead of creating a new instance with the current default locale.
