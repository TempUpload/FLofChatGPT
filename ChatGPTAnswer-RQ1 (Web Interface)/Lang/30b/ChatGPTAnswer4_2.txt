The issue seems to be on lines 1455-1458, where the function checks if the next characters in cs and searchChars match, but doesn\'t handle cases where there\'s no valid low surrogate character following a high surrogate.\nThe updated JSON report, taking into account this potential issue, would be:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Check whether any character from a given array (`searchChars`) appears in a given CharSequence (`cs`).

This is known as a surrogate pair.\nYour error message suggests that containsAny may be incorrectly identifying the presence of a supplementary character when only half of its surrogate pair is in the CharSequence.

Supplementary characters in Java are characters that cannot be represented with a single 16-bit char and need to be represented with a pair of char values, also known as a surrogate pair.

Additionally, the iteration over the string needs to account for the possibility of supplementary characters and should increase by more than 1 if a supplementary character is encountered.'}]
