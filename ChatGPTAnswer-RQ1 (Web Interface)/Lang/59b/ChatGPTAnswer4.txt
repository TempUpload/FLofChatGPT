Specifically, the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error is due to the same issue identified at line 884, where \'strLen\' is used instead of \'width\' in the \'str.getChars\' method. The test case also supports the identified issue at line 892, as the \'size\' is incremented by \'width\' even when \'strLen\' is less than \'width\', leading to an incorrect result.'}]
