The actual behavior may vary depending on the implementations of the called methods. You should review the contract of each method to understand its behavior when null or invalid values are passed as arguments, or when it may return a null value.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and unit test case, it seems that the issue is related to parsing the date "February 29" for a non-leap year, which is not valid since February only has 28 days in non-leap years.
