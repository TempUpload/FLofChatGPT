[{'answer1': 'The function parseInto() seems to parse a string text from a specified position into a ReadWritableInstant object using a DateTimeParser.

The expected result has the year 2004, while the actual result has the year 2000.

The computeMillis method is expected to calculate the date-time in milliseconds, but seems to not be handling the year correctly when only the month is given as input.'}]
