The test case is trying to format a negative time period, but the returned string does not have the expected negative sign.\nThe problematic code could likely be in the portion of the code that handles negative numbers, and how they are transformed into the printed length.

If the negative sign is being lost during the conversion from a long to an int, you may need to revise the handling of negative numbers to ensure they are printed correctly.'}]
