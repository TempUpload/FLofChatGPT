Analyzing the code snippet along with the given error message and unit test cases, it appears that the error arises because the code does not properly handle negative millisecond values. Specifically, the conversion from long to int may discard the negative sign for small millisecond values.\nHere is the updated JSON object that highlights potential issues with the code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function appears to calculate the printed length of a ReadablePeriod object.

It might also be useful to add specific handling for negative values within this function.'}]
