[{'answer1': 'The function \'normalizedStandard\' is expected to take a PeriodType as an argument and convert the current period object into a normalized standard period of the given type. The period is normalized to the largest possible units, e.g., converting seconds into minutes/hours/days, minutes into hours/days, etc., as much as possible. Then, it converts any remaining months into years. The result is then constructed using the ISOChronology.\nBased on the provided code, it seems like there is no bug, as it\'s properly getting each of the time parts, converting them into milliseconds, creating a new period with the total milliseconds, and then separately handling years and months.\nHere\'s the requested JSON output:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'normalizedStandard\' normalizes the current period object into a standardized period of a given type, moving units to larger possible scales as much as possible (i.e., seconds to minutes/hours/days, minutes to hours/days, etc.), and then normalizing remaining months into years.",\n  "faultLocalization": []\n}\nIf any context or specific functionality is missing which makes this analysis incorrect, please provide more information.', 'answer2': 'The error message and test case indicate that the function has an issue when attempting to use a PeriodType that doesn\'t support the \'years\' field.
