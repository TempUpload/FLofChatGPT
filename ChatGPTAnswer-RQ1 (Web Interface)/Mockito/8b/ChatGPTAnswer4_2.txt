[{'answer1': 'Based on the given code snippet, the function seems to be registering type variables from a parameterized type, storing these variables into a map.

Considering this, the problem might be in the boundsOf method or the logic deciding whether to call it, as this is the only way that GenericMetadataSupport.getActualTypeArgumentFor() could be indirectly calling itself in the provided code snippet. I\'d assume that boundsOf could potentially be returning a type that is equivalent to the input, creating an infinite recursion. This needs to be confirmed with additional code, which isn\'t provided here.
