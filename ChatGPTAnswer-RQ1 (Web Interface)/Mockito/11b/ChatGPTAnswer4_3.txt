[{'answer1': '{\n"intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to generate a hashcode for an object. It\'s an overridden version of the \'hashCode()\' function found in the \'Object\' class in Java.

It defeats the purpose of the \'hashCode()\' function which is to distribute objects evenly across hash-based collections. Returning the same hashcode for every instance of the class would lead to a performance issue when used with these collections as all objects will land in the same bucket, effectively turning the data structure into a linked list."\n}\n]\n}'}]
