The error is being caused because the UnsupportedOperationException is thrown at line 123 in the captureArgumentsFrom method whenever a method with variable arguments (varargs) is encountered. This suggests that the logic to handle varargs is not implemented, causing a failure when encountered. The unit test case shows that methods with and without varargs are used, which likely leads to the invocation of the captureArgumentsFrom method and subsequently to the exception being thrown.
