The commented line suggests that it might be related to an issue (MATH-657), and this code snippet is incomplete without knowing the purpose of that line. The absence of this line might lead to incorrect results.\nAt line number 297, there is a return statement that refers to the variable \'isZero.\' However, the variable \'isZero\' is not defined in the provided code snippet.
