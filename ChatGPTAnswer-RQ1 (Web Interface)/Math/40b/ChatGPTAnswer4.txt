This configuration might be too strict for certain functions, causing the solver to not converge quickly enough, leading to TooManyEvaluationsException. The unit test uses different tolerances which might be more appropriate.\nThe maximal evaluation count is set to 100 in the solve method which might not be enough for the function to converge to a solution. Furthermore, the interval [3, 4.5] and the initial guess of 4.12 may not be suitable for the function being solved.\nThe function defined Math.pow(x, 3) - (2 * x) + 1 might be problematic in the sense that it may not have a root in the specified interval or it might be difficult for the solver to find the root with the given configuration.'}]
