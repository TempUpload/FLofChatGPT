Instead, the \'=\' operator should be used to update the maximum value found so far.', 'answer2': 'The provided unit test case and error message help in confirming the original suspicion about the code. The error message indicates that the value produced by the method getLInfNorm() of the ArrayRealVector class was not as expected. The expected value was 6.0 (which is the maximum absolute value in the vector vec5), but the actual value was 128.0.
