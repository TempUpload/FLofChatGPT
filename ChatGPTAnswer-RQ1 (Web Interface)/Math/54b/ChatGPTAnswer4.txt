Whether they will become actual issues depend on the input of the function, the implementation of the methods called (like \'negate\' or \'DfpMath.pow\'), and the execution environment.', 'answer2': 'Based on the new information (error message and unit tests), the error message indicates that the function toDouble is returning -Infinity when it\'s expected to return 0.0.

Additionally, it is important to understand that even though the error occurs in the test function testIssue567, the bug is not necessarily in that function itself but rather in the function under test (toDouble), which is not behaving as expected.'}]
