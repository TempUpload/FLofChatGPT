Looking back at the provided cosh function code, this issue likely arises from the approximation used for large magnitude inputs (x > 20 or x < -20). Specifically, the function is designed to return 0.5 * exp(|x|) for these cases to prevent overflow. However, when x is significantly large (around Double.MAX_VALUE), even 0.5 * exp(|x|) can overflow, resulting in Infinity instead of 0.0.\nGiven these observations, the updated JSON object identifying potential issues in the cosh function code is:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a double-precision floating-point number.
