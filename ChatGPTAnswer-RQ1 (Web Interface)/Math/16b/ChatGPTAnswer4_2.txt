The function handles large inputs (greater than 20 or less than -20) separately to avoid overflow, uses a different method for small inputs (less than 0.25), and otherwise calculates sinh using a standard mathematical identity.\nThe analysis didn\'t show any major bugs, but there are missing function calls exp(x, 0.0, hiPrec) and expm1(x, hiPrec) in the code.
