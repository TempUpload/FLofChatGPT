The code snippet provided is from Apache Commons Math\'s FastMath class. The specific method is the implementation of hyperbolic cosine (cosh) which is optimized for speed at the expense of absolute precision. The error message provided suggests a discrepancy between the expected and actual values when computing the hyperbolic cosine of a large number.
