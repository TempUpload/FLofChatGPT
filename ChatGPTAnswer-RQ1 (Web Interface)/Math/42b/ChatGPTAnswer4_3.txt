The primary suspicion now falls on the use of the \'mostNegative\' value, as this seems the most likely source of the negative value in the solution that the test failed to accept. Other points remain similar as they still represent potential issues in the code, but the way they might contribute to the observed test failure has been explained in more detail.'}]
