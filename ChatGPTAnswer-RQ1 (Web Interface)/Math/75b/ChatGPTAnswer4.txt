Providing more of the function could help identify potential bugs more accurately.', 'answer2': 'From the unit test cases, it seems that the getPct() function is expected to return the proportion of a certain value in a frequency distribution. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual outcomes when calling the function with the input Integer.valueOf(3), expecting the output to be 0.5 but getting 1.0 instead.\nGiven this additional context, we can further analyze the code snippet:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'getPct\' is intended to calculate and return the proportion of a certain value in a frequency distribution.
