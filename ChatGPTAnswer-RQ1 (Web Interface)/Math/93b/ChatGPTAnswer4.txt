The issue seems to arise from the rounding process where the difference may be significant enough to cause a test failure. The test case expects an exact match up to 15 decimal places for factorial of 17. Given the nature of rounding, small deviations can easily occur, which seem to be the cause of the failure.\nBased on this additional information, the analysis of the given code snippet is updated as follows:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to calculate the factorial of a given integer \'n\'.
