The previous analysis did not identify any potential issues in the provided function. However, considering the provided error and unit test case, it seems that the function\'s implementation to treat two NaN values as equal might be causing unexpected behavior. Specifically, in line 456 of the unit test case, the test seems to expect that two arrays both containing NaN should not be equal.\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to check the equality of two double variables.
