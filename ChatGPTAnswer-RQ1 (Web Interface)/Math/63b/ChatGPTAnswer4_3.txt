From the test case, it is clear that when both arrays contain NaN, the function is expected to return false. However, as currently implemented, the function would return true in this case because the Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y) condition would be true for NaN values, hence the overall return statement would be true.\nHere is the updated analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The purpose of this function is to check if two double values, \'x\' and \'y\', are equal.
