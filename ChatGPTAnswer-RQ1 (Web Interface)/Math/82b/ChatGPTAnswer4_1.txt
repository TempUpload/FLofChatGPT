I highly recommend adding relevant checks and handling edge cases properly to prevent any runtime errors.', 'answer2': 'Given the additional context of the failing unit test case, I\'ll analyze the provided code snippet accordingly. The error message shows that the result of the optimization process is not what is expected (11.5 instead of the expected 10.0). This may indicate an issue with the selection of the pivot row in the Simplex algorithm implementation, which is the role of the function provided in the first prompt.
