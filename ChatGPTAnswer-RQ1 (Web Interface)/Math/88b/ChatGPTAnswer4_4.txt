From the test case, it\'s expected that the values of solution.getPoint() at indices 1 and 2 should be 1.0, but from the error message it\'s apparent that the value at index 1 is actually 0.0.\nThis discrepancy might be caused by the process of assigning coefficient values in the getSolution() function.
