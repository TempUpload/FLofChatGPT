The main issue is that when getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() returns a value of 2.0, the division in the line ret = d / (d - 2.0); would result in division by zero, which leads to -Infinity or NaN in Java. Furthermore, the inverseCumulativeProbability function which eventually utilizes this domain value does not seem to handle -Infinity or NaN properly, leading to the IllegalArgumentException.\nHere is the updated JSON object reflecting this analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'getInitialDomain\' calculates an initial domain value.
