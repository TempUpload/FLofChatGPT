This suggests that the getSumSquaredErrors() method is sometimes returning a negative value, which is not intended, since a sum of squared errors should not be negative.\nThe issue could potentially be due to the calculation inside the getSumSquaredErrors() function, which is susceptible to floating point precision errors that could result in a small negative number when the true mathematical result should be zero. This would typically happen when sumYY is very close to (sumXY * sumXY) / sumXX and the subtraction operation results in a small negative number due to the limited precision of floating point numbers.\nWith this additional context, I can provide a revised analysis of the code snippet in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `getSumSquaredErrors` is intended to calculate the sum of squared errors in a statistical context, using the formula (sumYY - (sumXY * sumXY) / sumXX).
