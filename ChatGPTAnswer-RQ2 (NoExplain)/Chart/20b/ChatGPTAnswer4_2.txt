[{'answer1': 'Based on the code snippet provided, the primary potential bug is that the superclass constructor is called with the same parameters for both paint and outline paint, and for stroke and outline stroke. The code as written would not differentiate between the two, which could lead to unwanted results. In JSON format, the results would look like this:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe line with the potential bug is line 95. The superclass is called with identical arguments for both the paint and outline paint parameters, and also for the stroke and outline stroke parameters. As per the conventional way of calling the constructor, it is likely intended that outlinePaint and outlineStroke parameters should be passed instead of repeating paint and stroke.', 'answer2': 'Given the error message and the unit test case, the bug appears to be on line 95, where the constructor is called with the same arguments for both the paint and outline paint, and stroke and outline stroke. This results in the outline paint being the same color as the paint, which fails the unit test case expectation of the outline paint being different (Color.blue). The JSON format of the results would look like:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThis suggests that the code on line 95 should likely be revised to correctly differentiate between the paint and outline paint, and between stroke and outline stroke. Likely, it should be something similar to: super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);'}]
