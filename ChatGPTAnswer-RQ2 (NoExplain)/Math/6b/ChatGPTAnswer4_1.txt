It might be worthwhile to ensure that these classes and their constructors are properly defined and that they interact correctly.\nLine 51: Similar to line 50, there might be concerns with the Incrementor and MaxIterCallback classes, so it would be advisable to ensure their correct definition and interaction.\nKeep in mind that further context might reveal additional areas of concern or clarify that the identified lines are not problematic.', 'answer2': 'Sure, based on the provided error message and the unit test case, the problem seems to be related to the number of iterations not being updated correctly.
