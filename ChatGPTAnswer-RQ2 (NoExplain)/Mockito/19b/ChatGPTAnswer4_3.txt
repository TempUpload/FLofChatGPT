This likely points to a problem with the OngoingInjecter returned by the filterCandidate method.\nLooking at the initial code snippet, the following potential bugs are noted:\nIf the mocks collection has more than one element, the thenInject method of the OngoingInjecter instance returned at line 41 simply returns null. Depending on what otherSuperUnderTesting.candidate1 represents and how it is used, this could be the reason why it\'s not null as expected.\nIf the mocks collection contains exactly one element, the thenInject method attempts to set the value of field on fieldInstance to the single mock object. If this fails, it attempts to set the field using new FieldSetter(fieldInstance, field).set(matchingMock). If either of these steps fail, the error is reported but execution continues and the mock object is returned.
