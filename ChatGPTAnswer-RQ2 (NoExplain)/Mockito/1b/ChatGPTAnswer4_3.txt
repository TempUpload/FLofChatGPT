[{'answer1': 'From analyzing your code snippet, I\'ve detected the following potential issue:\nThe method captureArgumentsFrom() might not work as expected when invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs() returns true. In this case, an UnsupportedOperationException is always thrown, which could cause the program to stop executing further. This could be a potential bug, but it might also be intended behavior - it depends on the context in which this code is used.\nHere is the corresponding JSON response:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "faultLocalization": [\n        {\n            "lineNumber": 123\n        }\n    ]\n}', 'answer2': 'The error message you provided suggests that the issue is indeed with the UnsupportedOperationException being thrown at line 123. This line of code seems to be preventing the captureArgumentsFrom function from executing when the method of the invocation object has variable arguments (isVarArgs() returns true). Given the context provided by the unit test, it\'s likely that the behavior of the captureArgumentsFrom function when dealing with variable arguments needs to be defined, instead of just throwing an exception.\nHere is the updated JSON response:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    "faultLocalization": [\n        {\n            "lineNumber": 123\n        }\n    ]\n}'}]
