This is a common place where null checks are necessary.\nOn line 100, it assumes that mockSettings and the returnTypeGenericMetadata passed to returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing are not null.

I recommend using more robust static code analysis tools for a comprehensive analysis.', 'answer2': 'With the additional error message and unit test case provided, we can further analyze the code snippet. The MockitoException suggests that the problem lies in the attempt to serialize a non-serializable type, as the error message states:\nlua\nCopy code\nYou are using the setting \'withSettings().serializable()\' however the type you are trying to mock \'NotSerializableShouldBeMocked\' do not implement Serializable AND do not have a no-arg constructor.\nThe unit test case indicates that NotSerializableShouldBeMocked is the result of a getSomething() call on a mock object created with RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS.\nSo, the problem lies in the fact that the original code is trying to make the mockSettings serializable even when the object that mockSettings is trying to mock might not be serializable. In other words, the function withSettingsUsing in the original code is not considering whether the objects are serializable or not before making mockSettings serializable.\nHere is an updated "fault localization" analysis:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    }\n  ]\n}\nIn this case, line 99 is potentially the most suspicious. The code mockSettings.serializable() is called without checking if the object to be mocked is serializable. It could be useful to introduce checks or try-catch blocks to handle this potential issue.'}]
