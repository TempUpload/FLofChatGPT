Instead, it references an undefined variable scope, which might cause a compile error unless scope is defined elsewhere in the class. This can be confusing and may lead to unexpected behavior.\nPossible Logical Error with Conditional Operator: On lines 216-217, the use of the conditional operator (?:) might be incorrect due to the missing expression between : and ;. The correct syntax for the ternary operator is condition ? expr1 : expr2.
