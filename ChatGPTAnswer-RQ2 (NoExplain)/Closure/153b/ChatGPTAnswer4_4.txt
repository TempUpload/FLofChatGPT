If parent doesn\'t have exactly one child, the subsequent call to replaceVarWithAssignment(n, parent, gramps) might behave unexpectedly.\nLine 641: The method call Preconditions.checkState(n.getType() == Token.NAME) could throw an exception if the condition is not met. It might be beneficial to handle this scenario more gracefully.\nLine 665: The method call MakeDeclaredNamesUnique.ContextualRenameInverter.getOrginalName(name) seems suspicious due to the potential typo in getOrginalName. It\'s likely supposed to be getOriginalName, and the typo could lead to a compile-time error.\nLine 676: The method replaceVarWithAssignment(v.getNameNode(), v.getParentNode(), v.getParentNode().getParent()) is called, but the definition of this method is not provided. It might lead to an issue depending on how it\'s implemented and what it expects.\nLine 671: Nested conditions checking for v != null appear in different parts of the code, which might make the logic harder to follow and more prone to errors.
