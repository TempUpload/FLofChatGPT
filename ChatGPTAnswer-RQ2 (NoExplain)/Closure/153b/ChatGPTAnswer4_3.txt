This means the code snippet might be failing to correctly handle or declare variables, especially when those variables are externs.\nThe error specifically mentions the disparity between a VAR node and an EXPR_RESULT node. A VAR node represents a variable declaration (like "var extern"), whereas an EXPR_RESULT node often represents a simple expression that isn\'t necessarily a declaration.\nGiven the context provided in the error message, let\'s analyze the initial code snippet once more:\nIn the code snippet, the method declareVar is called every time a new variable is encountered.
