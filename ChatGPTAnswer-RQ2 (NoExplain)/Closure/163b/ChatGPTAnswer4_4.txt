This means that the issue is probably not with the code directly but how the code interacts with the optimization process.\nThe initial code snippet (from the first prompt) appears to be defining a constructor or global function but without enough context, it\'s hard to determine if it has direct relevance to the error.\nGiven the aforementioned points, the lines of the original code snippet that could be potentially suspicious (in descending order of suspicion) might include:\nThe line involving Preconditions.checkState. If the checkState method modifies or checks any global state or assumes anything about method declarations, it might not play well with method motion optimizations.\nThe lines setting this.nameNode and this.module, as these indicate that we are mutating the global state of some object.
