If either of these fields is null, there might be issues with the maybeRestrictTwoNames method (assuming based on context).\nLine 275 and 285: The methods getTypeIfRefinable(left, blindScope) and getTypeIfRefinable(right, blindScope) could potentially return unexpected values which might not be handled elsewhere. It\'s always important to validate the output of such methods, especially if they interact with external or mutable data.\nLine 277 and 287: The code is setting leftIsRefineable and rightIsRefineable based on the result of the condition leftType != null and rightType != null, respectively. If there\'s a chance that these types could be non-null but still invalid (or vice versa), then these checks may not be sufficient.

This method might not be correctly determining or refining the type, which could cause the warning mechanism to miss the undeclared property.\nLine 277 & 287: If the type refinement (leftType and rightType) is not accurate or is missing some edge cases, it could lead to missing warnings. For example, if the type isn\'t refined properly, the code might not be able to detect the usage of unknownProp on a Type object, and thus not generate the warning.\nLine 295: The merging function might be merging types incorrectly or might not be handling specific cases leading to the system not recognizing the unknown property.\nStill, the direct relation between the provided error and the snippet is hard to establish without the broader context.

If not, it refines the blindScope using right.\nIf condition is true, it restricts the rightType and then possibly restricts both left and right names based on their types and the condition.\nBased on this flow, here are some points of interest and potential bugs:\nAfter setting leftIsRefineable to false in line 315, the leftType is retrieved from left. If left.getJSType() could return null, then later operations like leftType.getRestrictedTypeGivenToBooleanOutcome(condition) in line 323 can throw a NullPointerException.\nSimilarly, after setting rightIsRefineable to false in line 335, the rightType is retrieved from right. If right.getJSType() can return null, then later operations can throw a NullPointerException.\nIf the method firstPreciserScopeKnowingConditionOutcome changes the state of the program or has side effects, then calling it multiple times might be problematic.\nThere is no explicit handling for when rightType is null and condition is true.
