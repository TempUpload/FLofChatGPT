If so, it uses checkEquivalenceHelper to check if both types are equivalent. If they\'re not equivalent, the function returns false.\nIf thisParamType is null and otherParamType is not null, the function returns false.\nThe function then moves on to the next parameters using getNext().\nOnce out of the while loop, the function checks if one of the parameters lists ended earlier than the other (meaning they have different lengths) and returns the result of the comparison between thisParam and otherParam.
