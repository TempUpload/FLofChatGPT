This exception occurs when trying to cast an array of type \'Object\' to an array of type \'String[]\'. The code assumes that the input array is of the same type as the element being added, but in this case, the input array is null, so a new array of type \'Object\' is created. \n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to make sure that when the input array is null, a new array of the corresponding type is created.
